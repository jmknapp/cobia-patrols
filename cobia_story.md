## 1. Sources

This account draws on two primary sources:

**Commander Albert L. Becker's Patrol Log (Fifth War Patrol)**
The official patrol report for USS Cobia's fifth war patrol, which includes detailed entries for June 8, 1945. The log records times, positions, torpedo expenditure, target descriptions, and tactical decisions in the compressed, matter-of-fact prose typical of submarine war diaries. (National Archives, NAID 101744401)

**USS Hammerhead (SS-364) Sixth War Patrol Report**
Hammerhead operated in a coordinated attack group with Cobia during May 1945, with Cobia's Commander Becker serving as Officer in Tactical Command (OTC). Hammerhead's report provides the complementary perspective on the May 14 action, including confirmation that Cobia's depth charging allowed Hammerhead to sink the cargo ship TOTTORI MARU. (National Archives, NAID 74823150)

**JANAC Records / Postwar Databases**
The Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee conducted postwar analysis matching Allied attack claims to Japanese shipping losses. Modern GIS databases (e.g., [Sunken Ships of WWII](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/fe88b5e18c6443c7afaf6e32f8432687)) draw on JANAC records. These identify both of Cobia's June 8 victims at position 8.933°N, 105.617°E:

- **Hakusa / 白沙** (6,799 tons) — Listed in some databases as "Survey Ship," but her history was more complex. According to [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E6%B2%99_%28%E7%89%B9%E8%A8%AD%E6%B8%AC%E9%87%8F%E8%89%A6%29), she was built in 1914 by William Gray & Co. in Hartlepool, England, and served as a Chinese customs patrol ship named **福星** (Fushing, "Lucky Star") before being captured by Japan in 1937. She underwent multiple conversions: to survey ship (1938), then repair ship (May 1944), and finally **transport ship** (March 1945). By the time of her sinking, Hakusa was officially classified as 特設運送船 (Special Transport Ship), based in Singapore—which fully explains why she was carrying aviation gasoline. The ~7,000-ton figure is reasonably close to Becker's estimate of 10,000 tons.

- **Nanshin Maru No. 22** (834 tons) — JANAC lists this small coastal tanker as Cobia's other victim. However, this identification is disputed. Some Allied records place Nanshin Maru No. 22 off Korea on June 7, sunk by USS Shad. Researchers John Alden and Mülthaler argue she actually survived the war and surrendered, meaning Cobia's first victim was a different small tanker whose identity remains unknown. 

  A possible source of the misattribution: Becker's patrol log designated the convoy as "**Ship-22**"—simply the 22nd ship contact of the patrol. Postwar JANAC analysts, matching attacks to Japanese losses, may have seen "Ship-22" in Cobia's report and connected it to "Nanshin Maru **No. 22**" partly because of the numerical coincidence. If so, the match was spurious—Becker's "22" was a sequential contact number, not a ship identification. The "Nanshin Maru" series comprised many 834-ton sister ships; Cobia almost certainly sank one of these, but which specific vessel remains unknown.

**Personal recollection of EM3c Harold Mason "Hal" Knapp**
My father served as an Electrician's Mate Third Class aboard Cobia during this patrol. He was from Springfield, Massachusetts. His presence aboard is confirmed by U.S. Navy muster rolls (National Archives, NAID 125745304), which list him as "KNAPP, Harold Mason." His memory of June 8, 1945, centered not on the attacks themselves but on their aftermath: standing watch on deck after the sinkings, seeing Japanese survivors in lifeboats on the surface, watching them drift away into fog and monsoon haze lit by intermittent lightning. He believed they were doomed. He felt helpless to do anything. This scene stayed with him for the rest of his life.

## 2. Factual Timeline (from the log)

### The Raw Log Entry

Below is Commander Becker's original patrol log entry for June 8, 1945, transcribed verbatim. Patrol logs were written in a compressed, telegraphic style to conserve space while recording essential tactical information. Times are in 24-hour format; positions are given as latitude/longitude (e.g., "08-20/105-20" means 08°20'N, 105°20'E). "AO" designates a fleet oiler (tanker).

> June 8 Headed for the barn. 0310 Ship-22 two tankers and one probable freighter 08-20/105-20 0325 Total of three pips on radar 0330 Barely visible in extreme black night, was a large heavily laden tanker, 500 feet long. With 20 fathom curve 20 miles distant precluded diving; an unidentified escort to evade; a second target to attack and a loaded tanker that would probably explode and light up the whole ocean when hit; decided to make attack with stern tubes with torpedo run about 3000 yards and pull clear of the fireworks after shooting. 0410 Fired four Mark 18-1 torpedoes. Torpedo attack-2 8-56/108-37 10000 ton AO. Went ahead flank to clear. One torpedo seen to broach after short 200 yard run. 0413 One dud hit heard on bridge, on sound gear and through hull. It had been a long time since COBIA had heard her torpedoes explode against enemy hull. Decided to give this baby all we had and then worry about the others. Reloaded aft and headed in for bow shot. 0438 Fired six Mk 14-3A torpedoes foreword. Torpedo attack-3 8-56/108-37, 10000 ton AO. First and fourth torpedoes were seen to take a jog to the left before settling down on their run. Second and fifth torpedoes hit - second under bridge and fifth half way between bridge and after structure. Target made excellent diving time until nose stuck in mud. Stern remained sticking out for about 20 minutes. Lots of dim lights flashing as crew abandoned ship. He was silhouetted against intermittent lightning flashes until at 0500 target sank. Loaded last three Mk 14-3A's foreword and headed for second target. 0510 Second target in sight-a heavily laden tanker. 430 feet long. He was apparently unaware of the fate of his pal - or may be they just weren't speaking. Wanted to make sure of this one with last three fish forward so at 0518 Fired three Mk 14-3A torpedoes set at six feet torpedo attack-4 8-56/108-37 5000 ton AO. 0519 All three fish hit. The target exploded in the most spectacular flash I have ever seen. Large chunks of him landed all around. All that remained was a large column of flame from burning gasoline. Broke out the movie camera and recorded this for posterity. Let all hands take a look while we took off after our remaining friend. Loaded with aviation gasoline, fire like daylight- water wasn't deep enough for the big one to sink- bow in mud stern out. 0637 Fired three Mk 18-1 torpedoes, depth setting of 6 feet; Torpedo attack-5 8-56/108-37. Sound tracked fish under target who turned toward after torpedoes passed under. Target could not be identified but was about 200 feet long. He was riding higher out of the water than had been other targets. Probably a small coaster set last remaining fish at 2 feet and at 0644 Fired last torpedo - torpedo sank at firing point. With black night precluding use of open sights, no trainers sight on 4" gun, unknown armament on target, target headed directly toward mine field 5 miles ahead and dawn 45 minutes off, reluctantly tossed this one back and bent on four engines and headed for deep water. 0830 Crossed 20 fathom curve 1200 7-05/105-39

### Derived Timeline

**June 8, 1945 — South China Sea, off the coast of French Indochina**

- **0310** — Radar contact designated Ship-22: two tankers and one probable freighter. Position approximately 08°20'N, 105°20'E.

- **0325** — Three distinct pips now visible on radar scope.

- **0330** — First target sighted visually in extreme darkness. A large, heavily laden tanker estimated at 500 feet in length. Conditions unfavorable: the 20-fathom curve lay 20 miles distant, precluding a diving attack; an unidentified escort was present; a second target remained to be engaged. Commander Becker assessed that the loaded tanker would likely explode spectacularly if hit, illuminating the area. Decision made to attack with stern tubes at approximately 3,000 yards and withdraw immediately after firing.

- **0410** — Fired four Mark 18-1 electric torpedoes (Torpedo Attack No. 2). Position recorded as 08°56'N, 108°37'E in the patrol log, though this longitude appears to be a transcription error—the other positions that day (initial contact at 105°20'E, noon position at 105°39'E) suggest the attack occurred around 08°56'N, 105°37'E, off the coast of French Indochina near the Mekong Delta. Target assessed as 10,000-ton fleet oiler (AO). One torpedo observed to broach after a 200-yard run.

- **0413** — One dud hit heard on the bridge, on sonar, and through the hull. First torpedo explosion against an enemy hull in some time. Decision to press the attack with all remaining weapons before engaging other targets. Reloaded aft tubes; maneuvered for bow shot.

- **0438** — Fired six Mark 14-3A torpedoes forward (Torpedo Attack No. 3). Same target, same position. First and fourth torpedoes observed jogging left before steadying. Second and fifth torpedoes struck—one beneath the bridge, one midway between bridge and stern superstructure.

- **0438–0500** — Target began sinking bow-first, nose stuck in the mud of the shallow shelf. Stern remained protruding above the surface for approximately 20 minutes. Dim lights observed flashing as crew abandoned ship into lifeboats. Target silhouetted against intermittent lightning flashes.

- **0500** — First target sank completely.

- **0510** — Second target in sight: another heavily laden tanker, estimated at 430 feet. Apparently unaware of the first tanker's fate—or, as Becker noted dryly, "maybe they just weren't speaking."

- **0518** — Fired three Mark 14-3A torpedoes set at six feet depth (Torpedo Attack No. 4). Target assessed as 5,000-ton oiler. Position unchanged.

- **0519** — All three torpedoes struck. Target exploded in what Becker called "the most spectacular flash I have ever seen." Large chunks of debris landed around Cobia. Only a column of flame from burning aviation gasoline remained. Movie camera deployed to record the scene. All hands permitted topside to observe while Cobia pursued the third contact.

- **0637** — Fired three Mark 18-1 torpedoes at six feet depth (Torpedo Attack No. 5) at the third target, approximately 200 feet in length, riding high—likely a small coastal freighter. Sound tracked torpedoes passing under target, which turned toward after the fish passed.

- **0644** — Fired last remaining torpedo. It sank at the firing point.

- **Post-0644** — Attack on third target abandoned. Conditions prohibitive: extreme darkness precluded open sights; no trainer's sight available on the 4-inch deck gun; target's armament unknown; target heading toward a minefield five miles ahead; dawn only 45 minutes away. Becker "reluctantly tossed this one back" and ordered four engines ahead, heading for deep water.

- **0830** — Crossed the 20-fathom curve into safer depths.

- **1200** — Position 07°05'N, 105°39'E.

## 3. My Father's Recollection (EM3c Hal Knapp)

My father, Harold Mason Knapp—Hal to everyone who knew him—was nineteen years old in June 1945, an Electrician's Mate Third Class aboard USS Cobia. Born May 13, 1926, he had enlisted in May 1943, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, with his parents' permission. He had been inspired by the stories of an older friend named Edgar "Eddie" Seguin, who served as an Electrician's Mate Third Class aboard USS Gato (SS-212)—the lead ship of the Gato-class, the very class to which Cobia belonged. By early 1943, Gato had already completed four war patrols, sinking Japanese ships off the Solomon Islands and surviving fierce depth charge attacks near Truk. When Eddie came home on leave to Springfield full of tales from the submarine service, Hal had listened. Eddie also mentioned that the sub service paid well—combat pay plus submarine pay amounted to about fifty percent more than base Navy wages. For a seventeen-year-old from Springfield, that was real money—money he could send home to his parents, which he did. But it wasn't just about the pay or the adventure. Hal was patriotic; the war was on, and he wanted to be part of it. Between the duty, the adventure, and the pay, he decided he wanted in. Throughout his service, he sent money home and received V-mail in return—letters from his three sisters and their girlfriends, photographed and shrunk to microfilm, then printed out on the other side of the world. Training took nearly a year. He shipped out from San Francisco and spent time on a submarine tender before joining Cobia's crew for her fourth war patrol in early 1945. By the time of Cobia's fifth patrol, Hal had been through one full combat deployment—including the death of a shipmate—and knew the rhythms: the tedium, the sudden violence, the retreat to deep water afterward. He knew what torpedoes sounded like when they hit, and what they sounded like when they didn't.

But he rarely spoke about the technical details of the war. What he remembered from June 8, 1945, was something else.

After the attacks—after the explosions, after the column of fire from the second tanker—he came up on deck for his watch. The night was still dark, the air heavy with monsoon humidity. Lightning flickered on the horizon. And there, in the water nearby, he saw them: Japanese survivors in a lifeboat. A small boat, low in the water, drifting. Not a mass of humanity—the first tanker was small, perhaps 800 tons, with a crew of fifteen or twenty men. What he saw was a handful of people in one or two boats.

Cobia could not stop. Submarines did not pick up survivors from enemy vessels—there was nowhere to put them, no way to guard them, no protocol for it. The boat was already maneuvering, already heading for the third target or for deep water. So my father stood his watch and watched the lifeboats recede.

They drifted away into the fog and haze, lit only by the lightning. He could see them for a while, and then he couldn't. He believed they were doomed. He felt helpless to do anything about it.

What he didn't know—what he couldn't have known, standing on that deck in the darkness—was that the ocean was on the survivors' side. The sinking occurred about 100 kilometers from the Vietnamese coast—too far to row in a few hours. But early June marks the onset of the Southwest monsoon: winds blow from the southwest toward the northeast, pushing toward the Vietnamese coast; surface currents reverse to flow northward along the shore. A lifeboat drifting with the wind and current would move toward land at roughly one to one-and-a-half knots. At that speed, landfall on the Cà Mau peninsula or Mekong Delta would come in two to three days—well within the survival window for men in a stocked lifeboat in tropical waters. But from Cobia's deck, in the fog and the lightning, all my father could see was men disappearing into what looked like an empty sea.

This memory stayed with him. Not the explosions. Not the fire. The boats. The dim shapes of men in them, getting smaller, vanishing into the murk. 

When my father talked about his time on Cobia—which was not often—he had a few stories he would return to. There was the Ralph Huston incident, when a man died on deck beside him. There was a humorous one about swimming under the boat and not surfacing for several alarming minutes—he would slip into an air pocket in the ballast intake beneath the hull and wait there, to the consternation of his shipmates who hadn't seen the stunt before. He was young and, by his own admission, reckless. But when he mentioned the lifeboats, his voice was different—quieter, more careful. He didn't dwell on it or elaborate. He would simply say what he had seen, and then move on. This was the one that had cost him something.

## 4. Reconstructed Narrative

The night of June 7–8, 1945, was the kind of darkness that submariners called "extreme black"—no moon, no stars, the sky sealed over with the low pressure of the approaching monsoon. USS Cobia was running on the surface in the South China Sea, somewhere off the coast of what was then French Indochina, in water so shallow that the 20-fathom curve lay twenty miles away. This was not good submarine country. A boat caught here in daylight would have nowhere to dive.

But Cobia was heading home. "Headed for the barn," as Becker put it in the log—Navy slang for returning to base. Her fifth war patrol was winding down, and she was bound for Fremantle. Commander Albert Becker had every reason to avoid trouble. And then, at 0310, the radar operator reported contacts: two large vessels and a probable third, bearing northwest. Tankers. Big ones. Heavily laden and slow.

For a submarine captain with a full load of torpedoes, the decision would have required weighing risk against reward. But Becker's situation was different. Cobia was nearing the end of her fifth war patrol without having fired a torpedo at anything worth a torpedo. There had been targets—by this stage of the war, American submarines often found themselves doing work that would have seemed beneath them in 1942. The Japanese merchant fleet had been so thoroughly destroyed that the great convoys were gone. What remained were coastal runners, small freighters, sampans. Becker had given standing orders to attack sampans carrying "new rope"—fresh cordage was a telltale sign that a fishing boat was being supplied by the Japanese military rather than operating independently. But you didn't waste a Mark 14 torpedo on a sampan. You used the deck gun, if anything.

This was not safe work. On Cobia's previous patrol—her fourth—Seaman First Class Ralph Huston had been killed during exactly this kind of surface action. My father was on deck when it happened. His job was to feed the belt for the .50 caliber machine gun. Cobia had been maneuvering to attack a sampan when they suddenly found themselves far too close. My father remembered looking across the water and seeing a man in a striped t-shirt holding a machine gun. The man opened fire and raked Cobia's deck with bullets.

The crew scattered for cover, but Huston was struck. My father recalled that Huston's arm was "hanging by a thread." He was a 20mm gun loader, twenty years old. He died the next day and was buried at sea. The sampan's bullets had also damaged Cobia's radar, forcing them to return to base for repairs. My father remembered that many sailors were slow to return to the boat afterward. Morale was very low.

And now, three months later, they were back at sea, still doing the same work. The fifth patrol had already given them reason to be grateful they were heading home. On May 14, in the Gulf of Siam, Cobia had attacked a convoy escorted by a Japanese minelayer—identified by Becker as HIJMS Yaeyama, but later records indicate it was actually HIJMS Hatsutaka. The attack went wrong almost immediately—and not because of the enemy.

A tragic comedy of errors began when Becker prepared to fire at an escort crossing their bow. Becker called out to his Assistant Approach Officer to "use 70 feet masthead height"—a standard calculation for ranging the target. But the conning tower talker, "a new man making his first run in this ship," heard "70 feet" and passed the order to the Diving Officer as a depth command. At the critical moment, when Becker raised the periscope for a firing bearing, it dipped underwater.

By the time they got back to periscope depth, the geometry had changed. The escort was now heading straight for them with a 5° angle on the bow—nearly bow-on, the worst possible firing solution. Becker saw the escort "let out a puff of black smoke, grabbed a bone in his teeth, and lined up on us." Hatsutaka had spotted the periscope. There was no time to swing for a down-the-throat shot. Becker pulled the plug and dove.

At 120 feet, with the submarine barely leveled off, Hatsutaka passed directly overhead and, as Becker wrote, "tossed over everything but the Kitchen Sink. About 16 charges went off above, below, port, and starboard—all aft however. Really rattled all loose gear about and put us on the bottom at 148 feet."

My father recalled that the depth charging lasted hours. Cobia went to the bottom and switched to silent running. In the darkness of the boat, the crew could hear the minesweeper's propellers growing louder overhead, then beginning to fade—because, as my father explained, they would fling the depth charge backward off the stern. "And then we'd get hammered."

They tried to move without pumping, to avoid making noise. Becker wrote that they "succeeded in scraping along and probably stirring up plenty of mud." But Hatsutaka wasn't fooled. One charge "caused a flash of fire and smoke from the control cubicle." They stopped all motors and lay on the bottom while the electricians inspected for damage.

The escort had been, as Becker put it, "a distinct bush leaguer up to the time we led with our chin." But now Hatsutaka had them playing his game. He made eight single runs, using his fathometer to drop charges "set deep in the mud all around us." Each run brought one to three depth charges, set to explode 40 to 70 seconds after he passed overhead. Becker wrote that "the old ship would hop from fox hole to fox hole as each went off." Water flooded through the stern plane packing glands; the head flood valves "spun to full open on each charge."

At some point during the attack, the captain came on the intercom and told the men they should say a prayer. Torpedoman Charles Stewart, who served aboard Cobia, recalled this moment in his memoir—the boat on the bottom, the explosions all around, the captain's quiet suggestion. What Stewart may have remembered as being "stuck in the mud" was more likely this deliberate crawl: Becker keeping Cobia on the seafloor, trying to creep away from the attack zone without using the pumps, because pumping would make noise. For what felt like an eternity, seventy men sat in the darkness of a submarine scraping along the bottom while explosions rained down from above.

When it was finally over, the damage was severe: all six forward torpedo tubes out of commission with bent gyro spindles, the number seven tube also down, the Torpedo Data Computer inoperative, high pressure blow valves leaking badly. Becker's assessment: "I take my hat off to the Electric Boat Company. They really built a tough hull into this ship."

Eventually Hatsutaka gave up—and there was a reason. The wolf pack had worked. While Cobia had been drawing the escort's attention, Hammerhead had been maneuvering to attack the main target: TOTTORI MARU, a 6,800-ton cargo ship. Hammerhead's first attack had produced a dud hit around noon—and that hit may have been what finally drew Hatsutaka away from Cobia, his job "half done."

That night, with most of her tubes repaired, Cobia surfaced and went after the convoy again. What followed was a surface gun duel unlike anything the crew had experienced. At 0102, with Cobia making a night end-around at 8,000 yards from the escort, Hatsutaka opened fire. "Was mentally sympathizing with HAMMERHEAD," Becker wrote, "when freight train passed overhead and landed about 2,000 yards over." He held course to see if the escort was just guessing.

He wasn't. Hatsutaka fired again, then turned toward and sped up. Becker put him astern and started tracking. They found they could make 18.5 knots on their "3½ engines" (one engine was on charge); Hatsutaka could only manage 16—well below her rated 20 knots, perhaps due to accumulated battle damage or worn machinery. Becker put him 30 degrees on the quarter and kept on an end-around, slowly pulling away while shells fell around them—"one close (1,000 yards) and the other wild."

At 0140, two torpedo hits on the target seen and heard. Hammerhead had gotten TOTTORI MARU. At 0159, the cargo ship sank. Hatsutaka dropped a couple of depth charges and headed toward the sinking to pick up survivors, and Cobia finally pulled clear.

The minelayer that had nearly killed them would not survive long. Just one day later, on May 16, 1945, HIJMS Hatsutaka was sunk by USS Hawkbill, losing 70 of her crew. The ship that had depth-charged Cobia for hours, that had driven her to the bottom, that had fired shells at her in the darkness—was herself on the bottom within 48 hours.

The rendezvous with Hammerhead that night was the kind of moment that submarine veterans remembered fondly. The two boats came alongside in the darkness, and the crews exchanged "compliments, condolences and spares—used rubber boat for spares and megaphone for chin music." Cobia needed spare gyro spindles for her damaged torpedo tubes; Hammerhead obliged. Hammerhead's captain promised to save them a little beer and headed for Fremantle. "Back to the salt mines for us," Becker wrote.

But the aftermath held one more moment that would prove significant. The next afternoon, May 15, Cobia was still in the area when they sighted a lifeboat full of Japanese survivors from TOTTORI MARU. About 75 men, many in the water, with wreckage to cling to. A Japanese floatplane—a "Jake"—was already searching the area.

Cobia took moving pictures. They did not take prisoners. They destroyed large unoccupied pieces of wreckage with 40mm gunfire to deny the enemy flotation. And then they left.

Becker's patrol report contains a remarkable aside—one of the few moments where a submarine commander allowed himself to reflect philosophically on the rules of engagement:

> "The rules of war are hard to understand. Here were about 75 healthy Jap sailors in uniform with lifeboat and lots of wreckage to hang onto. Plane out looking to send aid. Chances that they would live to continue the war against us excellent. We had to let them go. Had they been in the same condition on the beach there would have been no hesitation about shooting them. Howsomever, such is the laws by which we live."

This was May 15, 1945—three weeks before June 8. Becker had already faced the decision once: Japanese sailors in lifeboats, alive and drifting, with rescue likely on the way. He had let them go. The rules required it. And he understood, with the clarity of a man who had thought about it carefully, that those rules meant some of his enemies would survive to fight again.

When the next lifeboat appeared off the Mekong Delta three weeks later, neither Becker nor any man aboard Cobia could have been surprised by the protocol. They had been through this before. The only difference was that this time, there was no search plane circling overhead—just fog, and lightning, and the open sea.

What the crew of Cobia may not have fully appreciated at the time was that their ordeal had been part of something larger. For this patrol, Cobia was operating as part of a coordinated attack group—a wolf pack—with USS Hammerhead (SS-364) and the British submarine HMS Supreme. Commander Becker was O.T.C.: Officer in Tactical Command, leading the pack. But Allied coordination was imperfect: Becker's log notes that he was "unable to establish communication with SUPREME." The British and American submarines could manage basic tactical exchanges—Hammerhead's log notes that Supreme identified herself via short-range voice radio to prevent friendly fire—but the encrypted traffic needed for true coordination was apparently incompatible. Different cipher systems, different code books. HMS Supreme was patrolling the northern portion of the area, able to call out "I'm friendly" but unable to receive Becker's attack plans or patrol assignments.

The attack on May 14 had been a coordinated operation against a Japanese convoy—coordinated, at least, between Cobia and Hammerhead. While Cobia engaged the escort and took the depth charging, Hammerhead was maneuvering to attack the main target: a medium cargo ship that would later be identified as TOTTORI MARU, approximately 6,800 tons.

Hammerhead's patrol report tells the other side of the story. At one point, Hammerhead's crew "commenced hearing depth charges in direction of COBIA's position"—the sound of their sister boat being hammered while they worked to set up their own attack. The escort that was trying to kill Cobia was, from Hammerhead's perspective, "apparently busy with the COBIA," leaving the cargo ship more vulnerable.

Hammerhead's first attack missed—one torpedo suffered an air flask explosion—and the escort's gunfire drove them off temporarily. But they closed again for a night surface attack, firing three torpedoes. Two hit. TOTTORI MARU went down.

The confirmation came from Cobia herself. Becker's boat, having survived the depth charging and made emergency repairs, observed Hammerhead's attack: "seeing two hits, watching the target sink," as Hammerhead's report noted. The wolf pack had worked. The cargo ship was destroyed.

But the cost had fallen unevenly. Hammerhead got the kill; Cobia got the depth charges. The men aboard Cobia had spent hours on the bottom while explosions shook the hull, had been stuck in the mud with the captain telling them to pray, had limped away with most of their torpedo tubes damaged—all so that Hammerhead could line up the shot that sank TOTTORI MARU. This was how wolf packs were supposed to work: one boat draws the escort, another makes the kill. But knowing the tactical logic didn't make the experience any less harrowing for the seventy men inside Cobia's hull.

The men on Cobia's deck that night in June had already seen what a machine gun could do to a shipmate. They had already spent hours on the bottom while a minesweeper tried to kill them. They knew what it meant to be surfaced and exposed.

The targets submarine captains dreamed of—fat, slow tankers silhouetted against the horizon—had simply not appeared. Whatever torpedoes remained in the tubes, they were going home unfired unless something changed.

And now, at 0310 on June 8, something had changed.

Becker faced a tactical problem that the patrol log records in its compressed, emotionless way. He could not dive—the 20-fathom curve was twenty miles distant, and the water beneath Cobia's keel was far too shallow for a submerged approach. Bathymetric analysis suggests the water at the attack position was only about 12-15 meters deep—perhaps 40 to 50 feet. A Gato-class submarine drew about 5 meters; that left barely 7-10 meters between the keel and the mud. For the duration of this engagement, Cobia would be trapped on the surface, unable to escape beneath the waves if something went wrong.

The risk was not abstract. Earlier in the war, USS Darter had run aground on Bombay Shoal while aggressively pursuing Japanese ships in confined waters—her sister ship Dace rescued the crew, but Darter was lost. USS S-36 and USS S-27 had also grounded and been abandoned. Those crews had been lucky: a sister boat nearby, or friendly territory to swim to, or time to be rescued. Becker had none of those. If Cobia scraped bottom and stuck, there was no sister boat to rescue them, no friendly land within reach—just enemy-held Indochina, Japanese aircraft based at Saigon, and dawn only hours away. Seventy men would be killed or captured.

And there were many other ways something could go wrong. An unidentified escort was somewhere in the area. Dawn was only a few hours away, and a surfaced submarine caught in daylight was easy prey for aircraft. The targets themselves were tankers, probably carrying fuel oil or aviation gasoline—which meant that a successful hit might turn the entire seascape into daylight. The fireball would silhouette Cobia for any escort watching.

The convoy was heading northeast, hugging the Vietnamese coast—almost certainly bound for Saigon, about 150 nautical miles ahead, where Japanese air operations desperately needed fuel. They had likely departed Singapore, following the safest route available in mid-1945: north along the Malay coast, across the Gulf of Thailand, then up the Cambodian and Vietnamese coastline, staying in shallow water where submarines couldn't dive. It was the only defensive tactic left to a merchant fleet that had been hunted nearly to extinction. And it almost worked—they were within a day's sailing of their destination.

Cobia had been heading south, "for the barn," when the radar picked up the contacts. To attack, Becker had to reverse course and pursue—following the convoy into the shallows where his own boat was most vulnerable.

The decision Becker made was characteristic of the war's later patrols, when American submarines operated with increasing confidence and decreasing caution: he would attack with stern tubes at range, then run. Get in, shoot, pull clear of the fireworks.

At 0410, Cobia fired four electric torpedoes at the first target, a ship Becker estimated at 500 feet and 10,000 tons. One fish broached and ran wild. The others ran true but produced only a single dull thump—a dud, heard on the bridge, on the sonar, and through the hull. 

"It had been a long time since COBIA had heard her torpedoes explode against enemy hull," Becker wrote. The comment captures something important: this wasn't just a slow patrol, it was a long dry spell for torpedo attacks. There had been action—deck gun work against small craft, the grinding routine of war in 1945—but nothing that justified expending a torpedo. The crew had been at sea for weeks without hearing that particular sound: the distant thump of a warhead detonating against steel. Now, finally, they had a target worthy of the weapon—and the torpedo had failed to detonate.

Becker decided not to withdraw. "Decided to give this baby all we had," he wrote, "and then worry about the others." It was the calculus of a captain who had waited too long for this moment to let a dud stop him. He reloaded the stern tubes and swung the boat around for a bow shot, bringing all six forward tubes to bear. At 0438, Cobia fired again.

This time, two torpedoes hit.

The patrol log records what happened next with the detachment of a man who has seen ships die before. The first torpedo struck under the bridge; the second hit amidships. The tanker began to sink bow-first, but the water was too shallow for it to disappear. Its nose stuck in the mud, and its stern remained above the surface for twenty minutes, silhouetted against the lightning that flickered across the monsoon sky.

And in those twenty minutes, the men aboard the tanker abandoned ship. The log notes "lots of dim lights flashing as crew abandoned ship"—flashlights, probably, or lanterns, bobbing in the darkness as sailors climbed into lifeboats and rafts. Cobia's crew could see them. In the lightning flashes, they could see the outlines of the dying ship and the small boats pulling away from it.

At 0500, the tanker finally slipped under. Postwar records would attempt to identify her as *Nanshin Maru No. 22*, a small coastal tanker of 834 tons—though this attribution is disputed by some researchers. What is certain is that she was small (Becker had wildly overestimated her at ten times her actual size in the darkness), and that her crew had time to abandon ship. By then, Cobia had already loaded her last three forward torpedoes and was closing on the second target.

This ship was larger—postwar records identify her as *Hakusa* (白沙), approximately 7,000 tons. She had a complex history: originally a British-built cargo ship, then a Chinese customs vessel named *Fushing*, captured by Japan in 1937, converted to a survey ship, then a repair ship, and finally—as of March 1945—reclassified as a transport ship based in Singapore. She was heading to Saigon with supplies, including aviation gasoline. She had apparently not reacted to the first attack, or perhaps her crew had hoped to slip away in the darkness. At 0518, Cobia fired three torpedoes.

All three hit. What happened next was, in Becker's words, "the most spectacular flash I have ever seen."

Hakusa was carrying aviation gasoline. The torpedoes did not merely hole the hull; they ignited it. The ship did not sink so much as detonate. Large chunks of debris arced through the air and splashed down around the submarine. Where the tanker had been, there was now only a column of fire rising from the sea, burning gasoline spreading across the water.

There were no lifeboats from Hakusa. As a survey ship, she had carried over 300 crew and surveyors; as a transport, her complement would have been smaller—perhaps 80 to 150 men. However many were aboard, they almost certainly died in the explosion or the fire that followed. The first tanker's crew had twenty minutes to abandon ship; Hakusa's crew had seconds, if that. The contrast would become important later, when my father stood on deck and saw survivors. They came from the first ship, not the second. The men aboard Hakusa were already gone.

Becker broke out the movie camera and filmed it. He "let all hands take a look," as he put it in the log—rotating men through in shifts so that everyone who could be spared from their stations could come topside and see the burning tanker. Submariners almost never witnessed what their torpedoes did; usually you heard an explosion on sonar, watched a pip disappear from the radar scope, and that was it. Here was a nearly 7,000-ton ship burning on the surface, a column of fire visible for miles. Becker understood that the men deserved to see it. The war had perhaps eighteen months left, or twelve, or six—no one knew exactly. But everyone knew it was ending. Japan's merchant fleet had been gutted. These tankers had probably been carrying fuel for aircraft that would never fly. Still, the Navy would want the footage, and the crew—after the long dry spell, after the depth charging, after Ralph Huston—deserved this moment.

Among those men was a nineteen-year-old electrician's mate from Springfield, Massachusetts, named Harold Mason Knapp. He did not operate the torpedoes; his job was the boat's electrical systems, the motors and generators that kept Cobia alive beneath the surface. But submarines were small, and everyone aboard felt the hits, heard the explosions, knew when things went right and when they went wrong. And on that night, after the fires had burned down and the boat had abandoned its pursuit of the third target, Hal Knapp came up on deck for his watch.

The boat was still on the surface—had been on the surface throughout the entire engagement, with nowhere to dive if trouble found them. What he saw there was not the fire. The fire was already fading, the gasoline burning itself out. What he saw were the lifeboats.

They were still there, somewhere in the darkness between Cobia and the place where the first tanker had gone down. Small boats, low shapes against the water, barely visible except when the lightning flashed. They were drifting. The current and the wind were carrying them, and no one was coming to get them.

Submarine doctrine was clear on this point, and had been throughout the war. American boats did not pick up survivors from enemy vessels. There was nowhere to put them. A fleet submarine carried a crew of seventy or eighty men in a space designed for perhaps half that number; there was no brig, no holding area, no way to secure prisoners during a dive or a depth-charge attack. And there was no way to know if a lifeboat might contain someone with a weapon, or a radio, or the will to sabotage the boat that had just killed his shipmates. The standing order was to leave survivors in the water.

So Cobia left them. The boat was already maneuvering, already working its way toward deep water before dawn. The third target had escaped toward a minefield, and Becker had decided that pursuit wasn't worth the risk—not because he wanted to save ammunition, but because he had none left. His last torpedo had sunk at the firing point, a dud that never even ran. Every fish aboard had been expended. And dawn was only 45 minutes away. A surfaced submarine caught in daylight, in water too shallow to dive, would be helpless against aircraft. Four engines were driving the submarine southeast, racing toward the 20-fathom curve and the safety of deep water. There was no time to stop, no reason to stop, no possibility of stopping.

Hal Knapp stood his watch and watched the lifeboat get smaller.

What my father saw, standing on that deck, was a handful of men disappearing into fog and darkness. Not a crowd—the first tanker was small, with a crew of perhaps twenty. One boat, maybe two. A dozen men, give or take. Close enough to imagine as individuals. What he believed was that they were doomed—alone in the South China Sea, far from land, with the monsoon building and no rescue coming. The image was powerful and terrible: a small boat vanishing into the murk, men he had helped to attack now drifting off to die.

But the geography and oceanography tell a different story. The attack occurred about 100 kilometers from the nearest landfall—the Cà Mau peninsula and Mekong Delta coast. That's too far to row quickly, but June marks the onset of the Southwest monsoon: winds blow from the southwest toward the Vietnamese coast, and surface currents reverse to flow northward along the shore. A lifeboat would drift toward land at roughly one knot without any effort at all. Two to three days of drifting—survivable in tropical waters with provisions—and they would reach the coast.

My father never learned this. No one on Cobia did. The patrol report does not mention the survivors again; Japanese records from this period are fragmentary and often silent on crew fates. From the deck of a submarine racing for deep water, all he could see was men disappearing into what looked like an empty ocean.

But they probably survived. The monsoon was carrying them toward the Cà Mau peninsula, and two or three days later they likely made landfall.

And what awaited them there was not necessarily death. The Cà Mau peninsula was remote and swampy, yes—but it was also Japanese-occupied territory, and the Mekong Delta was an active Japanese operational zone. Villages lined every waterway; Vietnamese fishermen traveled by sampan; Japanese river patrols and gendarmerie posts operated throughout the region. A lifeboat crew coming ashore exhausted would likely have stumbled upon a fishing village within hours. They would have been recognized as Japanese, reported to local authorities, and transported by riverboat up the delta toward Cần Thơ, then Mỹ Tho, then Saigon. This was the normal administrative machinery of occupation, and it was still functioning in June 1945.

The most likely outcome: the survivors of that small tanker made it back to Saigon. They rejoined Japanese forces. They were there when Japan surrendered two months later. Whether they survived repatriation, whether they made it home to Japan, whether they lived long lives or died young—that, we will never know. But the men my father watched disappearing into the fog probably did not die at sea. The ocean carried them to shore, and the Japanese administration of the Mekong Delta carried them back to their own forces.

It is possible—even likely—that they survived the war.

Years later, back home in Springfield, Massachusetts, my father could still see that boat. The small shape. The dim figures of men. The way it shrank and faded as the lightning flickered and the haze closed in. He could still feel the helplessness of standing on that deck, doing his job, following orders, while other men—enemies, yes, but men—disappeared into what he believed was certain death.

This was not the only thing that happened to Hal Knapp in the war. He served on multiple patrols; he survived depth charges and mechanical failures and all the ordinary terrors of submarine service. He was stung by a Portuguese man-o-war during one swim call and had to be treated by the pharmacist's mate. Toward the end of his service, he developed an infected wound at the base of his spine—the result of his back hitting the edge of the hatch repeatedly when he was on watch and had to scramble below during emergency dives. But this was the thing he remembered most vividly. Not the explosions. Not the fire. The boat.

The boat that vanished into fog.

## 5. Why This Moment Was So Tragic

Submarine warfare in the Pacific was, by design, impersonal. American boats attacked from periscope depth or, when running on the surface at night, from distances measured in thousands of yards. They fired torpedoes and turned away. They heard explosions—or didn't—and recorded the results in their logs. They almost never saw the men they killed.

This was not squeamishness; it was geometry and doctrine. A submarine's survival depended on remaining undetected, and detection meant destruction. Lingering near a torpedoed ship invited counterattack from escorts. Surfacing to inspect damage invited gunfire or ramming. The weapon itself—the torpedo—was designed to be launched from beyond visual range and to do its work out of sight. Even when attacks succeeded, submarine crews often knew it only from sonar, or from the distant rumble of a magazine exploding, or from the sudden disappearance of a radar pip. The enemy died invisibly, miles away, beneath the water.

June 8, 1945, was different.

The conditions that night—extreme darkness, shallow water, the need to attack on the surface—forced Cobia close to its targets. The geometry of the engagement put the submarine within visual range not only of the sinkings but of their aftermath. And the first tanker's slow death—twenty minutes with its stern protruding from the water—gave the crew time to watch.

They saw the flashlights. They saw the lifeboat—one, maybe two, holding the small crew of a coastal tanker. They saw men abandoning a ship that was dying beneath them. And when the ship finally went down, the survivors were still there, visible in the lightning, drifting on the surface of the South China Sea. Perhaps fifteen or twenty men in a small boat.

This was rare. Submarine logs are full of attacks, but they are almost never full of survivors. The men who fought this war launched their weapons and withdrew; they killed by instrument and calculation. The psychological distance this created was, for many veterans, a kind of protection. You could tell yourself you were sinking ships, destroying materiel, shortening the war. You could avoid thinking too much about the men inside those ships, because you never had to see them.

But my father saw them. And the seeing changed something.

The second ship's death only sharpened the contrast. Hakusa went fast—three torpedoes, a gasoline explosion, a column of fire. Her crew, perhaps 80 to 150 men, had almost no warning and almost no chance. They died in the explosion or the fire. There were no lifeboats from Hakusa. The first tanker's crew had time to abandon ship, time to get clear, time to find themselves adrift and alive in the aftermath. They survived the attack itself.

But here is the twist that only becomes clear with the benefit of hindsight and a map: the survivors were probably not doomed at all.

The attack occurred about 100 kilometers from the Cà Mau peninsula and Mekong Delta coast—too far for a quick escape, but the Southwest monsoon was setting in. June winds blow from the southwest toward the Vietnamese coast; surface currents reverse to flow northward along the shore. A drifting lifeboat would be carried toward land at roughly one knot. Two to three days of survival at sea—challenging but manageable in tropical waters with provisions—and they would reach the coast. The ocean itself was pushing them toward safety.

My father didn't know this. Standing on deck in the darkness, watching that lifeboat drift into fog and lightning, he saw men disappearing into what looked like an empty ocean. The haze and the night and the circumstances all suggested abandonment, isolation, doom. What he felt was real. What he believed was reasonable given what he could see. But it may not have been true.

This is what made the moment tragic—not for the Japanese sailors, who probably survived, but for the nineteen-year-old American electrician's mate who believed he was watching them die. He carried that belief for the rest of his life. He was following orders, doing exactly what the Navy had trained him to do, and he was watching men drift off to what he thought was certain death, unable to help them, forbidden to help them, knowing that his boat's torpedoes had put them there.

This was not guilt, exactly—or not only guilt. It was something more complicated: the sudden, unwelcome knowledge that war's abstractions are always, in the end, about human beings. Ships are crewed by men. Tonnage sunk is measured in bodies. Victory is built on a foundation of deaths that someone, somewhere, has to witness.

Most submariners were spared that witnessing. My father was not. And so he carried it—this image, this moment, a handful of men in a lifeboat disappearing into fog—for the rest of his life. It became the thing he remembered when he remembered the war. Not the adventure. Not the camaraderie. Not even the fear. The boat. The men in it. The way they vanished into the haze.

The irony is that the men in those boats probably lived. The tragedy is that my father never knew it.

## 6. Open Questions / Uncertainties

**What we do not know:**

- **The identity of the ships.** Postwar databases, drawing on JANAC (Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee) records, identify both of Cobia's June 8 victims:

  - **Hakusa / 白沙** (~7,000 tons) — Definitively identified via [Japanese Wikipedia](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E6%B2%99_%28%E7%89%B9%E8%A8%AD%E6%B8%AC%E9%87%8F%E8%89%A6%29). Built 1914 in England, captured from China 1937, converted through survey ship → repair ship → and finally **transport ship** (March 1945). By June 8, she was officially a 特設運送船 (Special Transport Ship) based in Singapore, carrying supplies including aviation gasoline to Saigon. The avgas explosion is fully explained by her transport role.
  
  - **An unidentified small tanker** (~834 tons) — JANAC attributes this to *Nanshin Maru No. 22*, but this is disputed. Some records place that ship off Korea on June 7, sunk by USS Shad. Researchers Alden and Mülthaler argue Nanshin Maru No. 22 actually survived the war. A possible source of the misattribution: Becker designated the convoy as "Ship-22" in his log (the 22nd contact of the patrol), and postwar analysts may have matched this to "Nanshin Maru No. 22" based on the coincidental numbering. The "Nanshin Maru" series comprised many 834-ton sister ships; Cobia likely sank one of these, but which specific vessel remains uncertain.

  **Which ship was which?** Becker described two ships: the first (500 feet, 10,000 tons estimated) sank slowly with its stern protruding; the second (430 feet, 5,000 tons estimated) exploded in an aviation gasoline fireball. The avgas explosion strongly suggests Hakusa was the second target—repair ships routinely carried volatile supplies. The small tanker (whichever Nanshin Maru sister she actually was) was likely the first target, which sank more conventionally. However, this assignment is inferential; the patrol log does not name the ships.

- **The fate of the wrecks.** ETOPO bathymetry data shows the recorded sinking position (8.933°N, 105.617°E) is in water only **12.5 meters deep** (about 41 feet / 7 fathoms). At that depth, the stern of the first tanker would indeed have protruded above the surface as Becker described—the water simply wasn't deep enough to cover the entire hull. Such a shallow wreck would have been: (1) a navigation hazard requiring removal, and (2) an easy target for postwar salvage operations. The absence of a charted wreck today strongly suggests the hull was recovered for scrap metal. Hakusa, which exploded catastrophically ("large chunks of him landed all around"), may have been too scattered to salvage as an intact wreck, but debris would still have been cleared from the shipping lane.

- **The depth and geometry of the attack.** ETOPO bathymetry data shows the recorded attack position is in only **12.5 meters** of water—far shallower than previously estimated. At this depth, a Gato-class submarine (draft ~5 meters) could operate on the surface but had absolutely no room to dive. The convoy was hugging the coast, staying in shallow water where submarines couldn't submerge—a defensive tactic that ultimately failed when Becker attacked on the surface anyway. The shallow depth also explains why the first tanker's stern protruded: the water was barely deep enough to cover the hull.

- **The number of survivors.** The log mentions "lots of dim lights" during the first tanker's abandonment, but Becker was likely seeing flashlights or lanterns, not lots of boats. A small coastal tanker of ~834 tons would have had a crew of perhaps **15-25 men**—a small group that would have fit in one or two lifeboats. My father's recollection was consistent with this modest scale; he wasn't describing a mass of survivors but a handful of men in a small boat. This intimate scale may have made the image more haunting, not less.

- **The fate of the survivors.** No record exists, in American or Japanese sources, of what happened to these men. But analysis suggests they very likely survived. Oceanographically: the **Southwest monsoon** was setting in, with winds and currents carrying a drifting lifeboat toward the Cà Mau peninsula at roughly **1-1.5 knots**—landfall in **2-3 days**. After landfall: though the Cà Mau peninsula was remote and swampy, it was Japanese-occupied territory. The Mekong Delta was an active Japanese operational zone with river patrols, gendarmerie posts, and villages along every waterway. Survivors coming ashore would likely have been recognized as Japanese, reported to local authorities, and transported by riverboat up the delta to Saigon. The most probable outcome: the crew of that small tanker made it back to Japanese forces, was present for the August 1945 surrender, and was eventually repatriated to Japan. Whether they survived the postwar years, we cannot know—but they almost certainly survived the sinking, the drift, and the war itself.

- **The third target's identity and fate.** The ship that escaped toward the minefield—a small coaster, by Becker's assessment—is even more obscure than the tankers. Whether it survived the minefield, reached port, or was sunk later is unknown.

- **Could the third ship have rescued survivors?** The escaping coaster, if it survived the minefield, could have returned after Cobia withdrew. By 0830, dawn had broken. But rescue may not have been necessary. With the Southwest monsoon setting in, winds and currents were pushing the lifeboat toward the Vietnamese coast at roughly one knot. Even without rescue, the survivors would likely have made landfall on the Cà Mau peninsula or Mekong Delta within 2-3 days—a challenging but survivable drift in tropical waters.

**What we do know (from cross-referencing sources):**

- **One June 8 target is definitively identified; the other is disputed.** Japanese Wikipedia confirms **Hakusa (白沙)** (~7,000 tons) was sunk by Cobia at 08°56'N, 105°37'E on June 8, 1945. By that date she had been reclassified as a transport ship, carrying supplies including aviation gasoline from Singapore to Saigon—which fully explains the spectacular explosion. The first tanker's identity is less certain: JANAC attributes it to *Nanshin Maru No. 22* (834 tons), but researchers Alden and Mülthaler dispute this, arguing that vessel survived the war. Cobia's first victim was almost certainly one of the small "Nanshin Maru" series coastal tankers, but which specific ship remains unclear.

- **The two crews had very different fates.** The first tanker sank slowly; her crew of ~15-25 men had time to abandon ship and likely rowed to the nearby coast. Hakusa exploded catastrophically; her crew (perhaps 80-150 as a transport ship, down from 300+ as a survey vessel) almost certainly died instantly or in the fire. There were no lifeboats from Hakusa. The survivors my father watched drifting away came only from the first ship.

- **The May 14 target has been identified.** USS Hammerhead's patrol report, combined with post-war analysis, identifies the cargo ship sunk that day as TOTTORI MARU, approximately 6,800 tons. Cobia's role in drawing off the escort allowed Hammerhead to make the kill, which Cobia subsequently confirmed by observation.

**Where the log is firm:**

- Times, positions, and weapons expenditure are recorded with precision.
- Target descriptions (dimensions, silhouette, cargo assessment) are based on visual observation.
- Tactical decisions are explained in Becker's own words.
- The fireball from the second tanker was filmed; this footage may exist in Navy archives.

**Where memory and inference begin:**

- My father's account of seeing survivors is based on his recollection, shared on several occasions over the years. Memory is fallible, and details may have shifted over time.
- The emotional weight he attached to the moment is real but subjective; other crewmen may have experienced the same events differently.
- The assessment that the survivors were "doomed" is an inference based on conditions, not a confirmed fact.

**Cautions about over-claiming:**

This account reconstructs a narrative from a patrol log and a single veteran's memory. It does not claim to be a complete history of the engagement or the fate of those involved. The Japanese sailors who died that night—whether in the explosions or afterward, in the lifeboats—left no testimony that has reached us. Their experience of these events is, and will likely remain, unknown.

What we have is one perspective: an American electrician's mate, young and far from home, standing on the deck of a submarine and watching men disappear into darkness. That perspective is partial and human and shaped by years of remembering. It is not the whole truth. It is only what one man saw—and crucially, what he believed he was seeing. The geography suggests the survivors probably lived; the memory suggests my father never knew it. Both of those facts matter.
