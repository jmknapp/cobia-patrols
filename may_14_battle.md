# The Battle of May 14–15, 1945

*USS Cobia (SS-245) in the Gulf of Siam*

---

## Prologue: The Wolf Pack

On May 13, 1945, USS Cobia entered her assigned patrol area in the Gulf of Siam and headed for Pulo Panjang. She was not alone. For this patrol, Cobia was operating as part of a coordinated attack group—a wolf pack—with USS Hammerhead (SS-364) and the British submarine HMS Supreme. Commander Albert L. Becker, Cobia's captain, had been designated Officer in Tactical Command (OTC), responsible for coordinating the pack's operations.

The coordination was imperfect from the start. Becker directed Hammerhead to patrol a point 32 miles southwest of Pulo Wai while Cobia took station to the south. But HMS Supreme was another matter entirely. "Unable to establish communication with SUPREME," Becker noted in his log. The British and American submarines operated on different cipher systems; they could exchange basic recognition signals to avoid shooting each other, but the encrypted tactical traffic needed for true coordination was apparently incompatible. Supreme would patrol the northern portion of the area, able to identify herself as friendly but unable to receive Becker's attack plans.

At 0204 on May 14, Cobia made landfall on Pulo Wai by radar. By 0610, she had commenced her patrol ten miles south of the island. The hunt was on.

## Contact

At 0638, the radar operator reported a contact: two ships at 22,000 yards, bearing 120° true, on a base course of about 250°. Becker designated this Ship Contact No. 2 and commenced tracking.

The picture clarified over the next half hour. The targets were making 9.5 knots on a base course of 250°, zigging 30° at approximately ten-minute intervals. An escort patrolled on the starboard bow of what appeared to be a cargo ship—an AK in Navy parlance.

At 0703, Becker called battle stations torpedoes.

At 0713, with dawn beginning to silhouette the targets against the eastern sky, Cobia went to radar depth. The approach was developing nicely. At 0720, Becker ordered the boat to periscope depth.

Then the target zigged 30° toward—putting Cobia in an ideal position for a bow shot, roughly 1,100 yards with a 60° track. It was the setup every submarine captain hoped for.

But at that moment, the escort zigged across to take position on the cargo ship's port bow. Through the periscope, Becker watched the escort crossing Cobia's bow with a 90° track at about 800 yards. A snap decision: shoot the escort with three torpedoes, then fire the remaining two at the cargo ship. It was aggressive, but Becker made his call. He began a quick setup and told his Assistant Approach Officer to use 70 feet masthead height for the range calculation.

What happened next would haunt the attack.

---

## The Miscommunication

The conning tower talker was a new man, making his first war patrol in Cobia. He heard "70 feet" mentioned and passed the word to the Diving Officer: run at 70 feet.

It was a catastrophic misunderstanding. Becker had been giving a masthead height for the fire control solution, not a depth order. But the message had already gone down the chain. At 0735, when Becker raised the periscope for his firing bearing—gyros generating to zero, range 700 yards, track 90°—the periscope dipped underwater.

Two minutes later, at 0737, the periscope was back up. Becker commenced firing forward—Torpedo Attack No. 1. But the geometry had shifted. The track was now 130°, the gyros about 40° right. Through the periscope, Becker observed two torpedoes broaching down range—running erratically on the surface instead of tracking true.

The escort saw them. He turned away and combed the tracks, presenting his stern to the incoming torpedoes so they would pass harmlessly on either side. Becker fired his last two forward fish at the escort on a 180° track—a long shot, firing at a target moving directly away. Then he commenced swinging left for a stern shot at the cargo ship.

At 0740, the AK turned away. Becker swung back toward the escort, hoping to shoot him "down the throat"—the most dangerous shot in submarine warfare, firing directly at an oncoming target. But the Torpedo Data Computer began acting erratically, the range-to-angle solver jumping all over the scale. There wasn't time to set up for a 180° gyro bow-and-arrow shot.

At 0743, Becker gave the order: "Take her down to 120 feet. Rig for depth charge."

The water beneath them was only 145 feet deep.

## The First Attack

At 0745, the first pattern of six depth charges exploded—astern, to port, and above. Fairly close.

At 0755, a second salvo of four charges—astern, to starboard, above and below. Further out.

At 0802, Becker brought Cobia back to periscope depth. The escort was astern, "tearing all over the landscape," searching. The cargo ship was ahead, range about 4,000 yards, with a 90° angle on the bow, moving very slowly. Becker commenced reloading forward and started a second approach on the AK.

At 0826, the escort turned toward and the cargo ship turned away. Cobia went back down to 120 feet. The reload was complete, but the TDC was still out of commission.

At 0845, the escort passed directly overhead, making 13 knots. He didn't drop.

---

## HIJMS Hatsutaka

At 0935, with the escort having opened range, Becker came back to periscope depth. The escort was now searching to the northwest. Cobia continued clearing the area on course 270° true, the cargo ship barely visible ahead with a starboard angle on the bow.

At 1135, the escort was identified by Becker as HIJMS Hatsutaka—though post-war records indicate the vessel was actually HIJMS Hatsutaka, a 1,608-ton minelayer that had been converted to escort duty. She was heading toward Cobia now, searching and zigging 30° every five minutes. Becker kept Cobia's tail toward her and made ready the after tubes, hoping for an opportunity to fire using the Mark VIII angle solver—a backup to the malfunctioning TDC.

At 1143, Hatsutaka zigged, giving Cobia a 30° starboard angle on the bow at 1,800 yards. Becker commenced swinging right to bring the firing bearing on.

At 1147, sound bearing was nearly on. Becker raised the periscope for the firing bearing. Hatsutaka had zigged again—toward. Now she showed only a 5° starboard angle, nearly bow-on.

And then Hatsutaka saw them.

Through the periscope, Becker watched the escort "let out a puff of black smoke, grabbed a bone in his teeth, and lined up on us." She had spotted the periscope and was charging directly at them. There was no time to swing back for a down-the-throat shot. At 850 yards and closing fast, Becker pulled the plug and headed for the safety of a 3° thermal layer at 60 feet. He tried to swing left, off Hatsutaka's track.

## Everything But the Kitchen Sink

At 1150, Cobia had leveled off at 120 feet when Hatsutaka passed directly overhead.

What followed was the most intense depth charging of Cobia's war.

"Tossed over everything but the Kitchen Sink," Becker wrote. "About 16 charges went off above, below, port, and starboard—all aft however. Really rattled all loose gear about and put us on the bottom at 148 feet."

The charges had driven them into the mud. Becker kept the boat moving, trying to get off the bottom without pumping—because pumping would make noise. "Succeeded in scraping along," he noted, "and probably stirring up plenty of mud."

Hatsutaka's next charge was close aft and "caused a flash of fire and smoke from the control cubicle." Becker stopped all motors and lay on the bottom while the electricians inspected for damage.

The escort had been, as Becker observed, "a distinct bush leaguer up to the time we led with our chin." But now Hatsutaka had Cobia playing her game.

She made eight single runs, using her fathometer to pinpoint the submarine on the bottom. On each run, she dropped one to three depth charges, set deep—"in the mud all around us." The charges detonated 40 to 70 seconds after she passed overhead, timed to catch a submarine trying to creep away.

"The old ship would hop from fox hole to fox hole as each went off," Becker wrote.

Water flooded through the stern plane packing glands. The head flood valves spun to full open on each charge. Somewhere during this ordeal, the captain came on the intercom and suggested that the men say a prayer.

But the hull held. "No hull damage tho," Becker recorded. "I take my hat off to the Electric Boat Company. They really built a tough hull into this ship."

Hatsutaka was making 15 knots on her runs, hauling out to about 3,000 yards after each drop to let the mud settle before coming back for another pass.

## Breaking Contact

At 1320, with the main control cubicle apparently back in order, Becker decided to get underway—"so as to give him a moving target." Hatsutaka dropped a single charge at this moment and then headed away on course 250° true.

At 1351, Cobia came to periscope depth. Hatsutaka was distant and getting further. Becker headed in her direction and commenced repairs.

The damage report was grim:

- All torpedo tubes forward out of commission: Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with bent gyro spindles; No. 2 with a loose gasket in the drain valve
- No. 7 tube (aft) out of commission with bent gyro spindle
- Mark 18 torpedo No. 55932 with flooded main motor
- Torpedo Data Computer inoperative
- High pressure blow valves to Bow Buoyancy, Negative, and Safety leaking badly

Cobia was crippled. But not finished.

By 1944, the repair parties had worked miracles. The TDC was operating again. The high pressure blow valves had been tightened. All after tubes and two forward tubes were back in commission.

Becker surfaced and went ahead full in the direction Hatsutaka had disappeared. No. 4 engine wouldn't take full load—they suspected the overload relay in the main cubicle—so they put No. 4 on charge and ran on three engines.

Becker sent a message to Hammerhead requesting information. Hammerhead replied with the position of the convoy.

The hunt resumed.

## Night Action

At midnight on May 15, Cobia made radar contact on the convoy. The target was there, with an escort on her starboard bow. Becker commenced an end-around to port, working to get ahead of the convoy for an attack.

At 0035, battle stations torpedoes.

At 0050, Hammerhead sent a message indicating she was attacking from starboard.

At 0054, the target zigged toward, giving Cobia a 140° angle on the bow. The escort headed out to starboard. Then plain language came over the radio from Hammerhead: the escort was chasing her, and Hammerhead was telling Cobia to take the cargo ship.

Becker put No. 4 engine on the line and commenced pulling up on the target. No. 3 tube was back in commission.

At 0100, the escort had dropped back directly astern of the target, range 8,000 yards.

At 0102, the escort commenced firing.

"Was mentally sympathizing with HAMMERHEAD," Becker wrote, "when freight train passed overhead and landed about 2,000 yards over."

The escort wasn't shooting at Hammerhead. She was shooting at Cobia.

Becker didn't see how Hatsutaka could have spotted them at 8,000 yards, so he held course to see if she was just guessing.

At 0104, the answer came. Another salvo—wild this time—and Hatsutaka turned toward and increased speed. She had seen them.

Becker put her astern and started tracking on the TDC while the plot tracked the cargo ship. They found they could make 18.5 knots on their three-and-a-half engines; Hatsutaka's speed was only 16—well below her rated 20 knots, perhaps due to six years of hard wartime service or accumulated damage. Becker put her 30° on the quarter and continued the end-around, slowly pulling away from the pursuing escort.

Hatsutaka fired a couple more times—one close at 1,000 yards, the other wild. The cargo ship zigged right. Becker hoped they could beat Hatsutaka to her. Through the darkness, he could see the target silhouetted against intermittent lightning flashing behind her.

The escort slowed to 13 knots and headed toward the cargo ship.

At 0135, Becker made ready tubes and turned in, having achieved a position 80° at 9,000 yards on the target's port bow. Hatsutaka was now 10,000 yards on the target's port quarter.

At 0140, two torpedo hits on the target—seen and heard. Hammerhead had struck. Hatsutaka headed for the target at 17 knots.

Hammerhead reported: no torpedoes remaining.

Becker continued in at standard speed to finish the target off if needed.

At 0159, she didn't need it. The target sank.

Hatsutaka commenced firing at Cobia again, range 4,000 yards. Shells were falling all around them—"all over us with sound effects," Becker noted. He headed away at flank speed. The escort chased, swinging 30° away and firing another salvo at 0202.

At 0205, Hatsutaka dropped a couple of depth charges and headed toward the scene of the sinking at 13 knots. She had survivors to pick up.

Becker pulled clear to give her time to calm down. On radar, he had SJ interference at 295° true—another submarine. He exchanged recognition with Hammerhead and commenced closing.

Cobia needed spare gyro spindles for her torpedo tubes and a spare pulser network for her SJ radar. Becker figured they could find Hatsutaka later, picking up survivors and maybe a little less alert.

A message came from Supreme requesting instructions. Becker gave her the position of the attack and informed her they would try to trail Hatsutaka.

## Rendezvous

At 0343, Cobia made rendezvous with Hammerhead—Ship Contact No. 4. The two submarines came alongside in the darkness.

"Exchanged compliments, condolences and spares," Becker wrote, "used rubber boat for spares and megaphone for chin music."

Hammerhead's captain had information: she had gotten a dud hit on the cargo ship around noon the previous day. That hit had probably been what drew Hatsutaka away from Cobia during the depth charging—the escort abandoning her attack with her "job half done" to check on the convoy.

At 0421, Hammerhead promised to save Cobia a little beer and headed for Fremantle. "Back to the salt mines for us," Becker recorded.

Cobia started toward the scene of the sinking and spent the remainder of the night chasing rain squall pips and "objects-on-horizon."

At 0800, the hydraulic vent and replenishing tank in the after torpedo room carried away. At 0805, Cobia dove and headed for the scene, continuing repairs.

At 1015, they sighted an aircraft—a Japanese floatplane, a "Jake"—searching the area.

At 1501, Cobia surfaced. All tubes were back in commission.

---

## The Lifeboat

At 1530, Cobia sighted a lifeboat full of survivors. Many men were in the water. About 75 Japanese sailors in uniform, with their lifeboat and plenty of wreckage to hang onto. The Jake was still searching the area overhead—air rescue was clearly on the way.

Cobia took moving pictures. She did not take prisoners—it was too early in the patrol to encumber herself with POWs. She destroyed all large unoccupied pieces of wreckage with 40mm fire, denying the enemy flotation and salvage.

And then she left them.

Becker's patrol report contains a remarkable passage—one of the rare moments in a submarine war diary where a commander allowed himself to reflect on the nature of the war he was fighting:

> "The rules of war are hard to understand. Here were about 75 healthy Jap sailors in uniform with lifeboat and lots of wreckage to hang onto. Plane out looking to send aid. Chances that they would live to continue the war against us excellent. We had to let them go. Had they been in the same condition on the beach there would have been no hesitation about shooting them. Howsomever, such is the laws by which we live."

At 1630, Cobia recovered a life ring from the sunken ship. The stenciled name confirmed what postwar records would verify: TOTTORI MARU. The data on the life ring matched exactly with the target as observed during the morning attack.

Becker headed for the southeastern corner of the patrol area to put the ship on the bottom for repairs to the main cubicle.

The battle was over. Cobia had taken a brutal pounding, had been driven to the bottom and depth-charged for hours, had lost most of her torpedo tubes and her fire control computer—and had still come back to participate in the kill. Hammerhead had delivered the final blows, but it was Cobia that had drawn Hatsutaka's fury, Cobia that had kept the escort occupied while her sister boat maneuvered for the shot.

TOTTORI MARU—6,800 tons—lay on the bottom of the Gulf of Siam. Cobia, battered but unbroken, was still in the fight.

## Epilogue: Hatsutaka's Fate

The minelayer that had nearly killed Cobia would not survive long. On May 16, 1945—just one day after the battle in the Gulf of Siam—HIJMS Hatsutaka was sunk by USS Hawkbill, losing 70 of her crew.

The ship that had depth-charged Cobia for hours, that had driven her to the bottom at 148 feet, that had fired shells at her in the darkness—was herself on the bottom within 48 hours of their encounter.

Such was the brutal arithmetic of the submarine war in the Pacific's final months.
