FADE IN:

## ACT ONE: THE APPROACH

### SCENE 1

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - NIGHT**

*May 14, 1945. 0204 hours. The cramped conning tower is lit only by the amber glow of instruments. COMMANDER ALBERT BECKER, 30s, lean and focused, peers through the night periscope. Around him, the watch team works in near-silence.*

*The SJ RADAR OPERATOR, headphones clamped to his ears, studies the green sweep of his scope.*

**RADAR OPERATOR**
Landfall, Captain. Pulo Wai. Bearing three-four-zero, range twelve thousand.

*Becker straightens from the periscope.*

**BECKER**
Very well. Navigator, mark it.

*He glances at the clock on the bulkhead. Four hours until dawn.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
We'll take station ten miles south of the island. That puts us across the shipping lane to Singapore.

---

### SCENE 2

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - LATER (0638)**

*Dawn is breaking. The conning tower is more crowded now. Tension hangs in the air like cigarette smoke.*

**RADAR OPERATOR**
Contact! Bearing one-two-zero, range twenty-two thousand yards. Two... no, make that two ships, sir. Base course about two-five-zero.

*Becker is at the radar scope instantly.*

**BECKER**
Tracking party to the conning tower.

*Men begin filing in, taking positions at the plotting table, the TDC (Torpedo Data Computer), the periscope stand.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
What've we got?

**RADAR OPERATOR**
Two pips, sir. Big one and a smaller one. The small one's patrolling on the starboard bow of the other.

**BECKER**
Escort and cargo ship.

*(to the room)*

Sound battle stations, torpedoes.

*The GENERAL ALARM sounds—two blasts. Men pour through the boat, running to stations.*

---

### SCENE 3

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - LATER (0713)**

*The sky is brightening. Through the periscope, the silhouettes of ships are visible against the dawn.*

**BECKER**
Dawn's silhouetting them. Take her to radar depth.

**DIVING OFFICER (O.S.)**
Radar depth, aye.

*The boat settles. Becker watches the TDC operator—LIEUTENANT MARION—working the dials.*

**BECKER**
Talk to me, Marion.

**MARION**
Target tracking nicely, sir. Nine-point-five knots, base course two-five-zero. He's zigging about thirty degrees every ten minutes.

**BECKER**
And the escort?

**MARION**
Patrolling on the cargo ship's starboard bow. Range about a thousand yards from the target.

*Becker turns to the periscope.*

**BECKER**
Periscope depth.

---

### SCENE 4

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - LATER (0720)**

*Becker is at the periscope, turning it slowly. His face is pressed to the eyepiece.*

**BECKER**
Beautiful. Target just zigged thirty degrees toward. We're in ideal position—bow shot, eleven hundred yard run, sixty-degree track.

*He freezes.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Wait. The escort just zigged across. He's crossing our bow.

*He pulls back from the scope, thinking fast.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
He's giving me a ninety-degree track at eight hundred yards. That's too good to pass up.

*(decisive)*

Shift target to the escort. We'll shoot him with three fish, then put the remaining two into the cargo ship.

*He leans back to the periscope.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Quick setup. Tell the Assistant Approach Officer—use seventy feet masthead height.

*The CONNING TOWER TALKER—a young sailor, barely twenty, nervous—speaks into his sound-powered phone.*

**TALKER**
*(into phone)*

Diving Officer, run at seventy feet.

*Becker doesn't hear the error. He's focused on the periscope. The boat begins to settle deeper.*

---

### SCENE 5

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - CONTINUOUS (0735)**

*Becker grips the periscope handles.*

**BECKER**
Raising scope for firing bearing. Gyros generating to zero, range seven hundred, track nine-zero—

*He stops. His expression shifts from concentration to confusion.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Periscope's underwater.

*(louder)*

Why is my periscope underwater?

**DIVING OFFICER (O.S.)**
*(through speaker)*

Leveling at seven-zero feet as ordered, Captain.

*Becker's face goes white, then red.*

**BECKER**
I didn't order— Get me back to periscope depth! Now!

---

### SCENE 6

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - MOMENTS LATER (0737)**

*The periscope breaks the surface. Becker is on it instantly.*

**BECKER**
Damn it. Track's changed to one-thirty. Gyros are forty right.

*He watches two torpedoes in the scope.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Commence firing forward.

*The boat shudders as torpedoes leave the tubes. One. Two. Three.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Two fish broaching! They're porpoising down range!

*Through the periscope, the escort ship is turning.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
He's combing our tracks. He saw them.

*(grimly)*

Fire remaining fish. One-eighty track.

*Two more shudders. Becker watches.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Missed. All of them.

*He pulls back from the scope. His jaw is tight.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Swing left for a stern shot on the cargo ship.

**MARION**
Captain, TDC just went erratic. Range-to-angle solver is jumping all over.

*Becker stares at the useless machine. Outside, through the hull, they can hear the throb of the escort's propellers growing louder.*

**BECKER**
Take her down. One-two-zero feet. Rig for depth charge.

---

## ACT TWO: THE BOTTOM

### SCENE 7

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER**

*Red lights. The crew moves in near silence. The DIVING OFFICER watches his gauges. Depth: 120 feet.*

**DIVING OFFICER**
Depth of water is one-four-five feet, Captain. We've only got twenty-five feet under the keel.

*Becker has descended from the conning tower. His face is grim.*

**BECKER**
That's all we've got.

*They wait. The propeller noise grows louder, louder—then begins to fade.*

**SOUND OPERATOR**
He's passed overhead.

*A moment of hope. Then—*

*BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.*

*Six explosions, close aboard. The hull rings like a bell. Men grab for handholds. Loose gear crashes to the deck.*

**BECKER**
Damage report.

---

### SCENE 8

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - LATER (0755)**

*Another pattern of explosions—four this time. The lights flicker.*

**ELECTRICIAN'S MATE**
No serious damage aft, Captain. Some water through the stern plane packing glands.

*The propeller noise is circling now. Coming back.*

**BECKER**
He's making another run.

---

### SCENE 9

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - LATER (1147)**

*Hours have passed. The crew is haggard. They've been at battle stations since before dawn.*

*Becker is at the periscope again. They've come shallow to try another attack.*

**BECKER**
I have him. Eighteen hundred yards. Thirty-degree starboard angle on the bow.

*(to the control room)*

Making ready after tubes.

*He watches through the scope.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Sound bearing coming on. Raising scope for firing bearing—

*He freezes.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
He's spotted us. He just put up black smoke and he's turning toward. Range eight-fifty. He's lined up on us.

*The propeller noise is growing again—fast.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Pull the plug. Take her to one-two-zero. Try to swing left, off his track.

---

### SCENE 10

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS (1150)**

*The depth gauge needle swings: 80... 100... 120...*

*The propeller noise reaches a crescendo directly overhead.*

*And then the world explodes.*

*Sixteen depth charges go off in rapid succession—above, below, port, starboard. The hull heaves and bucks. Men are thrown across the compartment. Light bulbs shatter. Cork insulation rains from the overhead.*

*When the chaos subsides, they are on the bottom. Depth gauge: 148 feet.*

**DIVING OFFICER**
We're on the bottom, Captain.

*Becker pulls himself upright.*

**BECKER**
All ahead one-third. Try to get us moving without pumping. He'll hear the pumps.

*The boat shudders, strains. Doesn't move.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Keep trying.

*The propeller noise is circling again. Distant. Then closer.*

*BOOM.*

*Close aboard, aft. The control cubicle erupts in a flash of fire and smoke. Men scramble with extinguishers.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
All stop. All stop.

*(to the room, quietly)*

Secure everything. Rig for silent running.

*He picks up the intercom microphone. His voice, when he speaks, is calm.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
*(into intercom)*

This is the Captain. We're on the bottom at one-four-eight feet. The escort has us pinned. I want every man to... say a prayer. And stay quiet. That's all.

*He hangs up the microphone. In the red-lit silence, men look at each other.*

---

### SCENE 11

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - LATER**

*Time has become elastic. The escort makes run after run. Each time, they hear him pass overhead. Each time, they wait—40 seconds, 50 seconds, 70 seconds—for the charges to go off.*

*BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.*

*The hull "hops"—Becker's word—from one crater in the mud to another.*

*An ELECTRICIAN—young, barely out of his teens—works in the dimness of the control cubicle, checking connections by feel.*

**BECKER**
*(to no one in particular)*

He's using his fathometer. He can see us down here. He's laying his charges right in the mud all around us.

*Another run. Another wait.*

*BOOM. BOOM.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
I take my hat off to the Electric Boat Company. They built a hell of a hull.

---

### SCENE 12

**INT. COBIA - CONTROL ROOM - LATER (1320)**

*The electrician emerges from the cubicle, face smeared with grease and soot.*

**ELECTRICIAN**
Cubicle's back in order, Captain. She'll run.

*Becker nods. He's been listening to the propeller noise. It's different now—more distant.*

**BECKER**
He's opening range.

*(beat)*

All ahead one-third. Let's see if we can get off this bottom.

*The motors hum. The boat shudders. Groans. And slowly, slowly begins to move—scraping along the mud.*

**DIVING OFFICER**
We're moving, Captain.

*The propeller noise grows distant. Distant. Gone.*

**BECKER**
Take her to periscope depth. Let's see what's out there.

---

### SCENE 13

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - MOMENTS LATER (1351)**

*Becker at the periscope. The afternoon sun streams down through the water.*

**BECKER**
Escort's way off and getting further.

*He lowers the scope.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Damage report.

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
All forward tubes out of commission—bent gyro spindles on one, three, four, five, and six. Number two has a drain valve leak. Number seven aft is also down. TDC's still out. High pressure blow valves to bow buoyancy, negative, and safety are leaking badly.

*Becker absorbs this.*

**BECKER**
How many tubes can you give me by nightfall?

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
All after tubes. Maybe two forward.

**BECKER**
Then get to it.

*(beat)*

Send a message to Hammerhead. Ask for the convoy's position.

---

## ACT THREE: THE KILL

### SCENE 14

**EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (2350)**

*The sea is black and flat. Lightning flickers on the horizon. Two submarines are running on the surface, miles apart, converging on the same target.*

---

### SCENE 15

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - NIGHT (0000)**

*May 15, 1945. Becker is at the radar scope.*

**RADAR OPERATOR**
There he is, Captain. Same convoy. Escort on the starboard bow.

**BECKER**
Good. Commence end-around to port.

*(to the talker)*

Sound battle stations, torpedoes.

---

### SCENE 16

**INT. COBIA - CONNING TOWER - LATER (0050)**

**RADIO OPERATOR**
Message from Hammerhead, Captain. She's attacking from starboard.

*Becker nods. This is wolf pack tactics—two boats, closing from opposite sides.*

---

### SCENE 17

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - NIGHT (0054)**

*Becker is on the bridge now, watching through binoculars. The cargo ship is a dark shape against the intermittent lightning.*

**RADIO OPERATOR (O.S.)**
*(through speaker)*

Plain language from Hammerhead, Captain! Escort is chasing him. He says—take the cargo ship!

**BECKER**
Put number four engine on the line. All ahead flank.

---

### SCENE 18

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (0102)**

*The EXECUTIVE OFFICER is beside Becker, binoculars raised.*

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Escort's dropped back behind the target. Range about eight thousand yards.

*Becker is watching the escort through his binoculars. Then—*

*A flash on the horizon. A distant BOOM. A shell screams overhead and splashes two thousand yards beyond them.*

**BECKER**
He's firing at us.

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
At this range? He can't even see us.

*Another flash. Another BOOM. Closer this time.*

**BECKER**
He's sure trying.

*(beat)*

Hold course. Let's see if he's guessing.

---

### SCENE 19

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER (0104)**

*Another salvo. This one's close—a thousand yards.*

**BECKER**
He's not guessing.

*(to the helmsman)*

Put him astern. Let's see how fast he is.

---

### SCENE 20

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Cobia is running now, engines straining. The escort is behind them, flashing gunfire.*

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
We're making eighteen-point-five on three and a half engines. He's doing sixteen.

**BECKER**
Then we can outrun him.

*(beat)*

Put him thirty degrees on the quarter. We'll keep doing an end-around while we pull away.

*In the distance, the cargo ship is silhouetted against lightning.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Can you see Hammerhead?

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Negative. He must be on the other side of the target.

*They watch. The escort fires again—wild this time. Then slows. Turns back toward the cargo ship.*

**BECKER**
He's giving up on us. Make ready tubes.

---

### SCENE 21

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - LATER (0140)**

*They've worked around to the cargo ship's port bow. The escort is far astern of the target now.*

**BECKER**
We're in position. Range nine thousand yards, eighty degrees on his port bow.

*He lowers his binoculars. In the distance, two flashes of light appear—not lightning. Different. Sharper.*

*Then, across the miles of water, two THUMPS.*

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Torpedo hits!

**BECKER**
That's Hammerhead.

*The cargo ship is stopped now, visible in the lightning flashes. Listing.*

*The radio crackles.*

**RADIO OPERATOR (O.S.)**
Hammerhead reports: no torpedoes remaining.

**BECKER**
All ahead standard. Let's finish him if he needs it.

---

### SCENE 22

**EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (0159)**

*Wide shot. The cargo ship—TOTTORI MARU—rolls onto her side and slides beneath the black water. The escort is racing toward the sinking, ignoring the submarines now.*

---

### SCENE 23

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Becker watches through binoculars as the ship goes down.*

**BECKER**
He didn't need it.

*The escort opens fire again—at Cobia. Shells splash around them.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
All ahead flank. Let's give him some room.

---

## ACT FOUR: THE LIFEBOAT

### SCENE 24

**EXT. OCEAN - DAY (1530)**

*May 15, 1945. Afternoon. Cobia is running on the surface, heading back toward the scene of the sinking.*

---

### SCENE 25

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Becker is on the bridge with LOOKOUTS scanning the horizon.*

**LOOKOUT**
Object in the water! Bearing zero-nine-zero!

*Becker raises his binoculars.*

---

### SCENE 26

**EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS**

*Through binoculars: a lifeboat. Packed with men in uniform. More men in the water around it, clinging to wreckage.*

---

### SCENE 27

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Becker lowers his binoculars slowly.*

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Must be seventy-five of them.

**BECKER**
At least.

*High overhead, a distant speck: a Japanese floatplane, searching.*

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Jake's still out there looking for them. They'll be picked up.

**BECKER**
*(quietly)*

Yes. They will.

*He turns to a sailor with a movie camera.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Get this on film.

*The camera rolls. Men come up from below, drawn by word of what's in the water. They line the deck, watching. Among them, we see a young ELECTRICIAN'S MATE—nineteen, dark-haired, silent.*

---

### SCENE 28

**EXT. COBIA - DECK - CONTINUOUS**

*The lifeboat drifts past. Japanese sailors look up at the submarine. Some raise their hands—not in surrender, just... acknowledgment. They know they won't be taken aboard. They know they won't be shot.*

*The young electrician watches them pass. His face is unreadable.*

---

### SCENE 29

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Becker watches the lifeboat recede astern.*

**BECKER**
*(to himself)*

The rules of war are hard to understand.

**EXECUTIVE OFFICER**
Sir?

**BECKER**
Seventy-five healthy Japanese sailors. Lifeboat. Plenty of wreckage. Plane looking for them. Chances they'll live to fight against us again are excellent.

*(beat)*

We have to let them go.

*He turns back toward the bow.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Had they been in the same condition on a beach, there'd be no hesitation about shooting them.

*(long pause)*

Howsomever. Such is the laws by which we live.

---

### SCENE 30

**EXT. OCEAN - LATER (1630)**

*A life ring bobs in the water. Painted on it: TOTTORI MARU.*

*A boat hook reaches down and snags it.*

---

### SCENE 31

**INT. COBIA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*A sailor brings the life ring to Becker. He examines it.*

**BECKER**
Tottori Maru.

*(beat)*

Log it. That's our kill—Hammerhead's kill, anyway.

*He hands the ring back and looks out over the empty sea.*

**BECKER (CONT'D)**
Helm, come to course one-three-five. We'll head for the southeastern corner of the area. Put her on the bottom for repairs.

*(beat)*

Back to the salt mines.

---

### SCENE 32

**EXT. COBIA - DECK - SUNSET**

*The young electrician stands at the rail, looking back the way they came. The sea is empty now. The lifeboat is gone—over the horizon, or picked up, or just lost in the vastness.*

*He stands there for a long moment, watching. Then he turns and goes below.*

---

FADE OUT.

---

**TITLE CARD:**

*USS Cobia completed her Fifth War Patrol on June 18, 1945. Despite the depth charging on May 14, she remained on station and sank two more ships on June 8.*

*The young electrician's mate who watched the lifeboat that day was Harold Mason Knapp, nineteen years old, of Springfield, Illinois. He would remember that moment—and another like it, three weeks later—for the rest of his life.*

*HIJMS Hatsutaka—the minelayer that Becker identified as Yaeyama—did not survive long. On May 16, 1945, just one day after this battle, she was sunk by USS Hawkbill, losing 70 of her crew. The ship that had depth-charged Cobia for hours, that had fired shells at her in the darkness, was herself on the bottom within 48 hours.*

*USS Cobia is now a museum ship in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.*
