## Verified Muster Roll Entries

From the searchable PDF (OCR quality varies):

| Page | Date | Entry |

| 085 | August 1, 1945 | KNAPP, Harold Mason, 667-24-32 |

**Note**: He likely appears on additional quarterly rolls (Q4 1944, Q1 1945, Q3 1945, Q4 1945, Q1 1946) but the OCR didn't pick them up clearly. You can manually search the PDF.
