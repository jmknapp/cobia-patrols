Headed\nslightly atra and put him abaft beam usin flank speed\nwhile the TDC tracked him at 10 knots. fo minutes\nlater made out a long, low-lying ship apparently a sub\non the opposito sido of the channel. The patrol boat\nsoomed not so much trying to close us as trying to force\nus toward the waiting sub. He fired many rod and green\nflares and bursts of oxplosive ammunition from some\nrapid fire weapon. However instead of turning away, I\nkept the patrol boat abaft the beam and holded for the\nstrait. Left the patrol boat astern. Shore batteries\nfrom south-west tip of Lombok opened fire. Iny flares\nfrom patrol boat to direct firo; closest splash was\nabout 5,000 yards short. Apparently Japs wore firing\nblind covering middle of channel with area fire.

As thore were no fishing\nboats or small craft found south of Formosa it is believed that\ntho Japs have cloared this area of all such craft to permit blind\nbombing.\nThe TRUTSUKI escort oncountered on October 10 and later on\nOctobor 16 was ahoad of his convoy patrolling station and pinging.\nThe two landing craft escorts observod on October 10 were likewise\nconstantly changing their position in the formation.\nThe two coasters with air cscort encountored on October 22\nwere believed to constituto a sub trap. The two ships were small\nand not worth an air escort unless some such purpose were held.\nIt is believed that the first patrol boat contacted in\nSibutu Passago was directed toward us by the shore radar which was\non us and loud in the PR. His course and speed would have inter-\ncepted us had we not changed course to ovade him.\nIn Lombok Strait a sub - patrol boat toan was oncountered.\nThe patrol boat was obviously trying to force us to run close to\nthe Bali sido of the strait and a long, low-lying ship was sighted\nthere apparently a sub. The patrol boat fired flares probably\nto direct shore batteries from the Lombok side which fired an area-\ncovering bariage all shots being well clear of us.\nNo anti-sub measures were found of Cape Bojeador, in Apo\nEast Pass, in Cuyo ast Pass, or in the Makassar Strait.\n2-XTRA-\nCONFIDENTLL\n27\nEnclosure (a.)\n27",

It closed very stiffly by hand and bound at the\nsame spot always. The cause was probably a bent operating shaft,\nresulting from a close-miss aircraft bombing; but the actual cause\nwas impossible to diagnose due to our inability to approach the\nvent in the superstructure.\nIt was operated by hand several times, and thoroughly greased.\nTwo days later it would operate hydraulically except on rare\noccasions when a second motion of the hydraulic lever was necessary\nto open or shut the vent.\nThe bell crank on this vent was an unacceptable item from .B.\nwhich was never replaced. It is recomended that it be replaced.\n2. #5 AIR BANK - By isolating the various banks after a drop in\npressure had shown an air loak in the system, #5 bank starboard side\nwas found leaking. stream of bubbles was seen through the peris-\ncope also. The starboard side of this bank was bled down and\nsecured as we were unable to repair it on patrol.\n3. 1 H.2. AIR COMPRESSOR - The rings in the third stage of 1\nHardy Tynes High Pressure Air Compressor broke and bound the piston.\nSpare rings vero inserted to replace the broken ones. Repair was\nslow due to the complexity of the design and the lack of a ring\ninserting tool. Several woro broken when the piston was doing ro-\nplaced in the cylinder. Hore spare rings, and an inscrting tool\non the \"on board\" allowance instead of on the tender allowance is\nrecommended.\n4. PITCHSTER LOG - The rodmeter of the pit-log was damaged by a\nfloating log and the dynamic pressure line coused pormitting water\nto ontor. The lo stopped functioning.\nspare roameter was inserted and lowered to the top of the\ndamaged one. However the old rodneter would not drop clear. It\nwas probably c. ntod and caught in the guide bushing at the outer\nhull of the ship. is this casualty did not occur until the return\ntrip to the base nobody was put over the sido to investigate.\nHowever it is highly recommended that ship be dead in the water\nwhenever a spare is inserted.\n5. ATTACK PRISCO (92 KA 40T/1.4 HA) - Close bombs chipped the\nprism of this scope causing specks on the image and impaired light\ntransmission. tender repair job will bo the replacement of the\nprism.\n6. LARK 18 TORPIDO - One Mk. 18 torpedo developed a high voltage\nground. about a cupfull of fresh water was found in the botton of\nthe battery compartment. All cell tops were wiped ary, water was\nremoved from the battery compartment, and a blower was used for an\nhour to force hot air through the compartment.

The sliding valve was erratic on load changes.\nftor soveral flushings with clean oil it bohaved normally though\nit will require dismantling and cloaning during the next rofit.\n11. SJ-1 RADAR - The SJ-1 radar jammed the radio. 11 radar cases\nand radar parts were grounded but the radio was still jammed when\nthe SJ was operated.\nIt is recommended that each unit of the SJ-1 be tested with\na portable frequency meter with both radar and radio operating, and\nthat all antonna leads be shielded.\n12. .P.R. - After we wero bombed the PR showed a signal every\ntime the SJ motor generator was turned on. It was found to be\nthis local interference, but sounded in the PR like a slow sweep-\ning radar on 262 msc.

Loss of the \"\"\nscope made radar tracking more difficult, though not impossible,\nas the PPI was kept in operation.\n2.

V207(607) was replaced and\noperation normal.\n(6) Phantom echo before transittod pulso showed on CRT, as\nindication. Trouble caused by V9 grid being raised too sharply\ncausing 03 to be shock excited. Trouble traced to bad condenser C9.\nC9(.0068uf) replaced and oporation normal.\n(h) antenna training drive misalignment caused chatter in the gears,\nthus the speed of train was limited.\n3. RANGES (1) With the scope in operation a ship was picked\nup at 36,000 yards and tracking was started. Lobing was ineffective\nbeyond 22,000 yards. The ship was tracked to a range of 16,000 yards\nat which time it was identified as a hospital ship.\n(2) With the \"A\" scope out a patrol craft in Lombok Strait was\ntracked from 8,200 yards to 3,700 yards then back out to approximately\n8,000 yards.\nLAND (1) With the \"A\" scope in, land (Saipan, levation 1,550 foot)\nas initially seen at approximately 85,000 yards.\n(2) With the scope out, land (t.
