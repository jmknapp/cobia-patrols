MAJOR DEFECTS\nЈ\nBUSHIPS'\n1. BATTERIES-On December 8, while proceeding to station, both\nbatteries were watered with water containing salt. While the\nbattery was on float there was no indication of chlorine. About\ntwo hours after completion of watering we dove (1500) and im-\nmediately noticed a smell of chlorine in the boat. The concen-\ntration was not severe enough to cause discomfort. A silver ni-\ntrate test showed chloride ions present in the electrolyte in\nboth batteries. We stayed down about two more hours and used\nthe time to rig pumps to remove the contaminated electrolyte.\nFortunately there had been very little mixing of the con-\ntaminated water and the electrolyte and by pumping the level\ndown to -16 (two points below the average height before watering)\nit was possible to remove most of the salt.\n-s soon as the pumping was completed about a six hour job)\nthe batteries were put on charge and in about two hours there was\nno more indication of chlorine in the battery exhaust. The\ncharge was continued and we equalized for two hours. The volt-\nage was normal and there were no indications of weak individual\ncells. The gravity, because of removal of electrolyte was lo-\nwered about 9 points. After watering and charging and for the\npatrol the equalizing gravity was about 10 points lower than\nbefore removing the electrolyte.\nThe cause of the casualty was determined to be: 1, the\nproduction of unacceptable battery water at the stills and fail-\nure of personnel to blow it to fresh water tanks instead of\nbattery water tanks, and 2, failure of electricians mates to run\nsufficient water through the system before watering to test the\nnew water in the tanks.

COMPRESSOR - #31 HP air compressor had to be completely over-\nhauled half-way through the run, due to piston rings freezing and\nbreaking in all stages. Putting it out of commission for two days.\nThe probable cause is the irregular shape of the linors which\nneed renewing. Dospito the fact that all rings had been renewed on\nlast refit those that wore not broken were badly worn.\nThe compressor noods now liners and a complete check for align-\nment as it had given difficulty since commissioning.\n3. ACCUMULATOR - HP air line from Air Flask to accumulator of Hy-\ndraulic system developed a look at the accumulator base. The hole\nwas near the bulkhoad making silvor soldering a difficult job as\nthe pipe had silver soldered joints and could not be removed to\ngain access to the trouble.\nIt is recommended that HP fittings be installed on this pipe\nto facilitate any repairs to the line.\n4. TORPEDOES - Cobia carried a full load of Mk 23 torpedoes of\nwhich about 1/3 had leaky charging check valves. Some of these\nleaks were stopped by replacing the leather washer with a nylon\none. The rest could not be repaired.\nPorformance of the five torpedoes fired was good, all ran\nhot, straight and normal.\n5. VAPOR COMPRESSION STILLS - After 180 hours of operation it be-\ncame necessary to dismantle #32 vapor compression still because the\nreadings on the water produced ran over the maximum on the scale\non the Kleinschmidt tester. Three small leaks in the coils were\nsilver soldered and the unit reassembled and rewired after which\nit operated satisfactorily.\n6. AUXILIARY ENGINE - After a total of 1187 hours of operation a\nvalve stem on #23 unit of the Auxiliary Engine snapped about 2\"\nfrom the valve. The valve was ground up and expelled and no\npieces remained.

  "38": ".\nJ.S:S. COBIA- Third War Partol - Report of.\nQ. PERSONNEL\nUnless a regular system of classes is initiated only the\nmore enterprising will attempt to qualify. The freezing of rates\nof unqualified men, giving qualified men the desiriable billets re-\ngardless of seniority, and giving qualified men a choice of staying\nin or making the next patrol has done its part towards pushing\nqualification. Unqualified officers hold class daily with an\naverage of ten men to a class; qualified men demonstrate a piece\nof machinery to a group of 3 or 4 daily. In this way the unquali-\nfied man is given upward of two hours concertrated instruction\ndaily and unqualified officers must go deeply into a system before\nthey can explain it. Men received aboard qualified on other boats\ngo through the same routine as unqualified men except that they\nare not required to fill out a notebook.\nThe younger men we have recieved, both in our commissioning\nallowance and since, have developed suprisingly well. In\nseveral cases they have proven more valuable than the more ex-\nperienced older men. At first, these men, many just out of\nservice schools, were barely if at all able to hold their rates.\nWith some sea experience to fill the knowledge they were given\nin schools they have gradually turned out well and numerous of\nthem have been advanced.\nThe lookout competition each patrol has been a tremendous\nfactor in keeping the lookouts alert. The prestige of the winner\nas well as his prize gives him as enviable position among the\ncrew of the boat. Conversely, those who constantly miss things\nin their sectors are chided for their inefficency by their\nshipmates.\nNobody on the ship has been transferred to relief crews\nwithout being qualified. or disqualified. At the end of a run those\nqualified men who the head of department feels have done the best\nwork are given their choice of a transfer or another run. Though\nit ocasionaly envolves transferring a fiew of the men it would be\ndesirable to keep, the system acts as a reward for good work and\nas a stimulus for it.\n250\nOver 6 yrs.in USN\nNo. aboard\nQualified at start\n70\n47\n4\nUnqual men on first run\nQualified at end\n59\nAverage Officer age\nAdvanced in rating\n12\nAverage Chief age\nLess than 2 yrs.in USN\n30\nAverage Crow Age\n7232\n10\n27\n31\n22\nCONFIDENTIAL\n-37-\n38",

Only one contact was made on a target worth torpedo\nexpenditure and this was successfully attacked.\n2.\nAttack #1 on 14 January 1945 was a day periscope attack\non a coastal mine layer proceeding independently. Five torpedoes were\nfired from range 1180 Yards, 105° truck, small gyros and 4' depth setting.\nOne torpedo hit and sank the target. The COBIA surfaced to take a tempting\nphotograph of the sinking ship and was rewarded with an aircraft bomb as\nshe dived to avoid. No damage was sustained.\n3.\nTwo prisoners were brought back, taken from a raft on which\nthey claimed to have been adrift for forty days. Three cases of mumps, one\ncase of appendicitis and several other ailments, plus the condition of the\nprisoners kept the pharmacist mate busy. He is to be congratulated for the\nmeasures he took which prevented an epidemic of mumps.\n4.\nThe COBIA returned in good material condition. A normal refit\nby USS EURYALE and Submarine Division 182-2 relief crew should correct all\ndeficiencies noted.\n5.\nChlorine in the main battery was experienced in the Java Sea\nenroute to station. This was caused by watering with water above allowable\nsaline content. This casualty although nullified by the excellent remedial\ntreatment given the battory, emphasises the necessity for utmost vigilance\non the part of operating personnel at all times.\n6.\nThe state of morale, training, and cleanliness upon return\nfrom patrol was extremely high.\n7.\nThe squadron commander congratulates the commanding officer,\nofficers and crow on the damage inflicted on the onomy.
