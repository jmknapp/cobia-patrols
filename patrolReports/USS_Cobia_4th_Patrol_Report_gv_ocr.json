COBIA (SS245) - Report of Fourth War Patrol,\nThe fourth war patrol of the U.S.S. COBIA (SS245) covered a period\nof fifty-six (56) days of which twenty-five (25) were spent in areas off the\nINDO-CHINA Coast. Although many sampans and sailboats were encountered, only a\nfew targets were considered worthy of torpedo fire. Two-way communication with\nfriendly search planes was unreliable and offered little opportunity to vector\nCOPIA to enemy surface contacts. U.S.S. COBIA (SS245), U.S.S. ROCK (SS274), and\nU.S.S. GUAVIANA (SS362) formed a Coordinated Attack Group, the Commanding Officer\nU.S.S. COPIA being Officer in Tactical Command during the period 19-26 March.\nUpon joining Group on 27 March, the Commanding Officer U.S.S. ROCK assumed duties\nof Officer in Tactical Commend. On 21 February a main engine was improperly\nsecured from a charge, resulting in a near casualty to personnel from fumes\nemitted into a closed engine room. The heroic action of REMILLARD, Earl D.,\nCMOME (AA) (T), USN, and KUTZLEB, Robert E., MoMMlc, USN, without rogard to\npersonal safety, demonstrated their courage and resourcefulness as submariners\nand upheld the high traditions of the naval service. KUTZLEB'S actions un-\nquestionably saved the lives of both REMILLARD and DESMOND, Forrest E., MOMMlc,\nV-6, USNR, the throttloman on the affected engine. The Commanding Officer's\ndecision to return to EXMOUTH for medical treatment for injured personnel is\nconsidered sound in view of the short distance to run. The COBIA arrived\nEXMOUTH GULF on 23 February, transferred DESMOND to U.S.S. COUCAL, and departod\nthe following day.\n2.\nOn 26 February, two sea trucks, 300 tons each, were sighted through\nthe periscope, and proparations made to attack them with guns. They were engaged\nsoparately, and both sunk by the experienced gun crows of this submarine which\nhas accounted for six small craft by gun fire in four war patrols. Unfortunately,\nreturn fire from the second target wounded two members of the 20mm gun crew, and\nHUSTON, Ralph C., Jr., Slc, V-6, USNR, succumbed to gunshot wounds the following\nday, when COBIA was returning to FREMANTLE at four engine specd to transfor\nwounded personnel and effect repairs to a holod SJ radar wave guide and defective\nlobing motor. She arrived FREMANTLE on 4 March, made necessary repairs, and\ndeparted for patrol 8 March.\n3.\nOn 14 February a snoko contact developed into a five ship convoy,\nconsisting of two small coastal freighters and two escorts. An approach was made\non one froightor which was subsequently attacked with four Mk 14-3A torpedoes,\nfour foot dopth setting. The Commanding Officer watched two torpedoes run under-\n-1-\n42",

No anti-submarine measures were received on this\nattack. A suspicious contact was made during the night of 30 March, and a sub-\nforged approach was conducted. Target was noted to have a sail rigged, and un-\ncortain sound information prompted the Commanding Officer to fire one torpedo\nat what he thought might be an enemy submarino undor sail. The torpedo missad.\nThe decision to attack was probably based on the definite contact several days\ncarlior with a I-121 class submarino. This latter contact was mado close inshore\nduring daylight surface patrol and was not sighted after diving for an approach.\n4.\nOne floating mino was sighted off CMRANH BAY on 29 March; a\nproperly marked hospital ship was contacted 31 March; and two definito periscopo\ncontacts woro mado 3 oril south of PADARAN. No evidence of offensive action\nwas noted while opening the range on evasive courses. On 8 April, during sub-\nnorged patrolling, the 00D sighted one unidentified plano, two P-38s, one\nLiberator and one Catalina simultaneously, and apparently searching an area.\nAn attempt was made to communicato, both with SD most and VHF antennas, with\nno results. The Catalina was soon to land, after which the Commanding Officer\nsurfaced and closed plane, in the meantine establishing communications with one\nof the P-38s. Information was received that a ditched Liberator's survivors\nwore in the vicinity. The COBIA subsequently picked up soven crow members. The\nromaindor had been recovered by the Catalina. All were in excellent condition\nhaving boon in the water about ono hour.\n5.\nThe material condition of the CODIA on return from patrol is above\naverage and a normal refit will be conducted.
