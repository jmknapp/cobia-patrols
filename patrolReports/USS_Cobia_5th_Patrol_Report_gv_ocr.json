The Commanding Office of the COBIA was coordinator of\nattack group consisting at various times of the HAMMERHEAD, H.M.S. SUPREMME,\nHAWKBILL, BULLHEAD, and BERGALL. Patrol was terminated due to expenditure of\ntorpedoes.\n2.\nArea coverage was excellent. Many contacts were made with\njunks; one which was flying Siamese colors was sunk by a well conducted gun\nattack on 30 May. There were two contacts on convoys with ships worthy of\ntorpedo fire both of which were closed for attack. Of interest is the fact\nthat no aircraft contacts were made at night.\n3.\nTORPEDO ATTACK NO. 1: On 14 May a day periscope attack was\nmade on a minesweeper escort for a medium AK%; five steam torpedoes were fired\non large track, with large gyros for no hits. This attack was ruined by a\ntelephone talker mistaking an order for the assistant approach officer as an\norder to change the keel depth. This escort later, after an hours search,\nfound the COBIA and subjected her to a severe depth charge attack. This\nattack forced the COBIA to bottom; put all torpedo tubes out of commission\nand caused a small fire in the maneuvering room when some foreign material\nfell into the control cubicle. After repairs were made the COBIA surfaced\nand later was able to draw off the escort and allow the HAMMERHEAD to sink\nthe AK.\nTORFEDO ATTACK NO. 2: On 8 June a night surface attack was\nmade on a convoy consisting of two tankers and one unidentified escort. Four\nelectrie torpedoes were fired on 90° track, gyros 208, depth set 6 feet,\ntorpedo run 3300 yards. No explosions were obtained.

COBIA (SS245) - Report of Fifth War Patrol\nComment on.\n1.\nThe Fifth War Patrol of the COBIA, under the com-\nmand of Commander A. L. BECKER, U.S.N., was conducted in the\nGULF OF SIAM. Activity was co-ordinated at various times with\nH.M.S. SUPREME, U.S.S. HANTERHEAD, HABILL, BERGALL, and BULL-\nHEAD. The patrol was of forty days duration, trenty seven of\nwhich were spent in the assigned area, and was terminated be-\ncause of the expenditure of torpedoes.\n2.\nOne gun and six torpedo attacks were made upon the\nenemy, and three ships were sunk. Of particular excellence was\nthe series of attacks made during the carly morning hours of\n8 June. Dotermined to attack the enemy at an unexpected point,\nCOBIA proceeded into an arca ton fathoms deep and nearly two\nhours run inside of the twenty fathom curve. Upon locating\nenemy targets he executed a series of torpedo attacks which\nsank two valuable enemy tankers. This same aggressive spirit\nwas exhibitod on 14 May when COPIA unsuccessfully attac'ed a CM\nYABYAMA Class (EU), and then reloaded and commenced a second at-\ntack. After being detected she was subjected to a very severe\ncounter attack which drove her to the bottom in 148 feet of water.\n3.\nIt is of interest to note the description of the\nunusual denth charge attack of 14 May after COBI had settled to\nthe bottom. The depth charges were believed to be set deep and\nthen droned into the mud because the explosion occurred from\nforty to seventy seconds after the charge had been droned. It\nwas a source of great satisfaction to COBIA to be informed on\n19 May by HAWKBILL that she had sunk the YEYAMA (EU) shortly\nafter this attack upon COBIA,. HAWKBILL has since identified\nthis vessel as the HATSUTAKA rather than the YAEYAMA.\n- 1 -\n+44",
