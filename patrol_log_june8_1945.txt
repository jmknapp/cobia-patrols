USS COBIA (SS-245) — FIFTH WAR PATROL
Commander Albert L. Becker, Commanding

PATROL LOG ENTRY — JUNE 8, 1945

June 8 Headed for the barn. 0310 Ship-22 two tankers and one probable freighter
08-20/105-20 0325 Total of three pips on radar 0330 Barely visible in extreme
black night, was a large heavily laden tanker, 500 feet long. With 20 fathom
curve 20 miles distant precluded diving; an unidentified escort to evade; a
second target to attack and a loaded tanker that would probably explode and
light up the whole ocean when hit; decided to make attack with stern tubes with
torpedo run about 3000 yards and pull clear of the fireworks after shooting.
0410 Fired four Mark 18-1 torpedoes. Torpedo attack-2     8-56/108-37 10000 ton
AO.   Went ahead flank to clear. One torpedo seen to broach after short 200
yard run. 0413 One dud hit heard on bridge, on sound gear and through hull. It
had been a long time since COBIA had heard her torpedoes explode against enemy
hull. Decided to give this baby all we had and then worry about the others.
Reloaded aft and headed in for bow shot. 0438 Fired six Mk 14-3A torpedoes
foreword. Torpedo attack-3 8-56/108-37, 10000 ton AO. First and fourth torpedoes
were seen to take a jog to the left before settling down on their run. Second
and fifth torpedoes hit - second under bridge and fifth half way between bridge
and after structure.  Target made excellent diving time until nose stuck in mud.
Stern remained sticking out for about 20 minutes. Lots of dim lights flashing
as crew abandoned ship. He was silhouetted against intermittent lightning
flashes until at  0500 target sank. Loaded last three Mk 14-3A's foreword and
headed for second target. 0510 Second target in sight-a heavily laden tanker.
430 feet long. He was apparently unaware of the fate of his pal - or may be
they just weren't speaking. Wanted to make sure of this one with last three
fish forward so at 0518 Fired three Mk 14-3A torpedoes set at six feet torpedo
attack-4 8-56/108-37 5000 ton AO.   0519 All three fish hit. The target exploded
in the most spectacular flash I have ever seen. Large chunks of him landed all
around. All that remained was a large column of flame from burning gasoline.
Broke out the movie camera and recorded this for posterity. Let all hands take
a look while we took off after our remaining friend. Loaded with aviation
gasoline, fire like daylight- water wasn't deep enough for the big one to sink-
bow in mud stern out. 0637 Fired three Mk 18-1 torpedoes, depth setting of 6
feet; Torpedo attack-5   8-56/108-37. Sound tracked fish under target who turned
toward after torpedoes passed under. Target could not be identified but was
about 200 feet long. He was riding higher out of the water than had been other
targets. Probably a small coaster set last remaining fish at 2 feet and at
0644 Fired last torpedo - torpedo sank at firing point.  With black night
precluding use of open sights, no trainers sight on 4" gun, unknown armament
on target, target headed directly toward mine field 5 miles ahead and dawn
45 minutes off, reluctantly tossed this one back and bent on four engines and
headed for deep water. 0830 Crossed 20 fathom curve 1200 7-05/105-39
